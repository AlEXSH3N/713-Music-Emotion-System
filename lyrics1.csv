My mind is seeping into the darkness
My pulse is growing weaker by the moment
From fighting each battle in a war that can't be won
I might as well end it with a single shot to my skull

[Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me that the worst is yet to come
Don't tell me, don't tell me there's no justice after all
That fate mapped it out so perfectly
To fit the regards of the coward

[Verse 2]
The years I spent scrubbing the blood I never shed
Encased in fear, bound to repetition
You can't fool me, no, not anymore
I see the bastard's grin through your confession

[Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me that the worst is yet to come
Don't tell me, don't tell me there's no justice after all
That fate mapped it out so perfectly
To fit the regards of the coward

[Verse 3]
I wanna see you cower in the screaming echoes of your past
I wanna see you cower and burn this cycle into dust
I wanna see you cower and self destruct
And if that's not enough
You might also like[Bridge]
I'll haunt your dreams like you haunted mine
Claw at the sockets of your deceiving eyes
I'll make you rue the day
You ever laid your hands on me

[Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me that the worst is yet to come
Don't tell me, don't tell me there's no justice after all
That fate mapped it out so perfectly
To fit the regards of the coward

[Extended Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me that the worst is yet to come
Don't tell me, don't tell me there's no justice after all
That fate mapped it out so perfectly
To fit the regards of those cowards1Embed"

There's not a simple explanation for the things that I feel
There's no one word to tell you why I do the things that I do
I don't need you, I just want you
I can't love you, I'm too scared to

[Verse 2]
It's not a trick that's up my sleeve, it's just the heart inside me
And I spent so much time fighting the man that I am trying to be
Keep saying, I can't give in, I'm too proud
To think what I can't say out loud

[Chorus]
Don't know what this is
But I'm feeling it
Try keeping distance but
I've got more than gravity pulling me in

[Verse 3]
It's not a simple situation that I found myself in
Another conversation with myself I keep avoiding
You say run but I can't hear you
Something bigger keeps me near you

[Chorus]
Don't know what this is
But I'm feeling it
Try keeping distance but
I've got more than gravity pulling me in
I've got more than gravity pulling me in

I tried to ignore it, tried to be strong
I said I'd never feel what I felt that long
And now it's 2 am and I'm drunk and I'm calling you
And I can't fall asleep 'cause all I do is dream about you
It's times like this you gotta face the truth
I think I need somebody, I think that's you

[Chorus]
Don't know what this is
But I'm feeling it
Try keeping distance but
I've got more than gravity pulling me in

Summer comes, winter fades
Here we are, just the same
Don't need pressure, don't need change
Let's not give the game away
There used to be an empty space
A photograph without a face
But with your presence and your grace
Everything falls into place

'Cause I might not say it back
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when

You see just where we're at

One more late night
On the northern line
And up to King’s Cross I will follow

With a nickel-plated tooth and a briefcase
Hold my breath when the policemen drive by
Bye-bye, I've done been told
Not to show this face around here anymore
She fell in love with a criminal
I keep a bag under the bed for the day I steal her away
Her momma called me a devil, her daddy called me a thief
Her sister called me trouble, her brother called the police

Well, I guess you'll just have to kill me
But after that, I'll be back to be with my baby again
This world ain't strong enough to pull us apart

It ain't a life with all the hate and all the love
And there's no wrongs without the rights
What's left is pain and blood, well

Alright, Morrison
It's time to settle our differences in a rap battle

[SOLDIER: 76]
Not with that hip-hop garbage
Gimme something that rocks
Oh yeah... I can work with this

[REAPER]
Hey, Jack
No hard feelings when I slaughter you on this track

[SOLDIER: 76]
Ha, such a comedian
Before we get started, I must apologize
I'm not a hero anymore, so I'm not gonna be nice
I'm a soldier who put the world on his shoulders
You're just a ghost who can't hold his composure
I'm older, but I'm getting better with age
Call this a eulogy, you're getting sent to your grave
Old dog, new tricks, my bite's as bad as my bark
I can't help kicking your ass, old habits die hard

[REAPER]
I've been to the grave, I've already come back
But I'll be at your funeral, and I'll look good in black
I'll be undertaking while you're Over-watching
Trust me, I'm not the only dead man walking
I always got annoyed when you played boy-scout
Then you got destroyed, how's unemployment now?
You were never a commander with an ass I would kiss
Speaking of which, 76, put your sights on this
You might also like[SOLDIER: 76]
I'm not pointing fingers
I won't say who betrayed us
But we've got a weak link
His name is Gabriel Reyes

[REAPER]
It's easy to make me a scapegoat for the blame
While you're the head of Overwatch taking all of the praise
On the Blackwatch, my job was the hardest
You called yourself a 'hero' while I'm hauling your garbage

[SOLDIER: 76]
I never pegged you as the whiny kind of guy
What you gonna do, Gabe
Cry, cry, cry?

[SOLDIER: 76 & REAPER]
In with the old, out with the new
They don't make 'em like they used to
Kids these days got it easy
Try as hard as they want, they're not gonna be me
Justice and vengeance (Justice and vengeance)
In an epic standoff (In an epic standoff)
You might call us old news, but don't call me 'grandpa'
[REAPER]
Back in Switzerland, we both survived the blast
All you had to show for it was a minor scratch

[SOLDIER: 76]
But these scars go deeper
You should see that, Reaper
The only reason I was leader is because you were weaker

[REAPER]
I'll feast on your soul like a wholesome snack
I have no moral code that will hold me back

[SOLDIER: 76]
I'm not with Overwatch, I don't roll like that
Just goes to show, you don't know Jack

[REAPER]
Death walks with a couple of shotguns
You'd better run when it blossoms

[SOLDIER: 76]
Spraying and praying, you ain't even aiming
My Tactical Visor is activating
I don't see Mercy, better find a nurse
I know you're into black magic, but I'm your curse
[REAPER]
You're a washed-up has-been, better get practice
Lookin' like a burnout with his letterman jacket

[SOLDIER: 76 & REAPER]
In with the old, out with the new
They don't make 'em like they used to
We been fightin' since the Crisis
I got a lotta war stories for my kids
Rainin' shells, and pulse grenades
Everybody better get to shelter (Get to shelter)
Hasn't anyone told ya to respect your elders?

[SOLDIER: 76]
You reap what you sow, check your ego
And keep that mask on, you demon freakshow

[REAPER]
You're a walking clichè, I'm a sleek bandito
Say ""Hasta la vista,"" mi amigo

[SOLDIER: 76]
I'm an army of one
Punk, get off my lawn

[REAPER]
I'm on the graveyard shift, and I'll finish the job

[SOLDIER: 76]
Sorry, but it doesn't count if you finish it badly
I'll keep you in line
Who's your daddy?
Oh... this is awkward

[ANA]
Oh, please, I've never laughed harder
How could either one of you believe that Pharah was your daughter?

[REAPER]
So you're telling us now...

[SOLDIER: 76]
That it can't be one of us?

[ANA]
I wouldn't tell you two even if she was

[SOLDIER: 76]
Come on!

[ANA]
Between your petty insults, rhymes that are boring
I can't believe for once that I'm the one snoring
You have the gall to call yourself grown men?
Ha, just remember, mother knows best

[SOLDIER: 76, REAPER & ANA]
In with the old, out with the new
They don't make 'em like they used to
Kids these days got it easy
Try as hard as they want, they're not gonna be me
Justice and vengeance (Justice and vengeance)
In an epic standoff (In an epic standoff)
You might call us old news

[ANA]
But don't call me 'grandma'

[SOLDIER: 76]
An eye for an eye

[REAPER]
You can't bargain with death

[ANA]
It's time to put this battle to rest

[SOLDIER: 76]
*groans*
He started it

[REAPER]
Ugh, shut up

Car is parked, bags are packed
But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again

[Verse 2]
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again

[Bridge]
It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I going to do?

All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again

Stood under the city lights
I see you, just like it’s the very first time
My heart is racing, and I don’t know why
Our fortress beneath the sheets
I hold you, just like it’s our very last night
Can’t help but feeling like we’re out of time

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna leave but you know that I have to
I don’t wanna speak 'cause I know my words won’t do
I’m hurting like hell 'cause you know that I want you
I want you, don't wanna leave you
I don’t wanna leave but you know that I have to
I don’t wanna speak 'cause I know my words won’t do
I’m hurting like hell 'cause you know that I want you
I want you, don't wanna leave you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hey)
Don’t wanna leave you
Don’t wanna leave you
Don’t wanna leave you
Don’t wanna leave you

[Verse 2]
Morning light creeps down the walls
And our clothes are scattered all over the floor
Jumpers of mine I didn’t know you wore
A warzone inside my head
Every time I start walking towards your front door
'Cause I don’t really wanna go no more
No, I don’t

I don’t wanna leave but you know that I have to
I don’t wanna speak 'cause I know my words won’t do
I’m hurting like hell 'cause you know that I want you
I want you, don't wanna leave you
I don’t wanna leave but you know that I have to
I don’t wanna speak 'cause I know my words won’t do
I’m hurting like hell 'cause you know that I want you
I want you, don't wanna leave you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hey)
Don’t wanna leave you
Don’t wanna leave you (Yeah, yeah)
Don’t wanna leave you (Yeah)
Don’t wanna leave you (Yeah, yeah)
Don’t wanna leave you (Yeah)
Don’t wanna leave you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna leave but you know that I have to
I don’t wanna speak 'cause I know my words won’t do
I’m hurting like hell 'cause you know that I want you
I want you, don't wanna leave youEmbed"

Over the sea and far away
She's waiting like an iceberg
Waiting to change
But she's cold inside
She wants to be like the water

[Pre-Chorus]
All the muscles tighten in her face
Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same
Just like water

[Chorus]
Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world to me

[Verse 2]
On comes the panic light
Holding on with fingers
And feelings alike
But the time has come
To move along

Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world

[Bridge]
Can you help me?
Can you let me go?
And can you still love me
When you can't see me anymore?

[Chorus]
Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world
You're the other side of the world
You're the other side of the world to meEmbed"

Say what you say, push me away
Fuck my head up, beg me to stay
How could I be better off without ya
When I'm not better off without ya?
Lie that you're done, like you're gonna run
Like you don't love, I'm calling your bluff
You say the water's too rough
But I won't leave you when you're sinking

[Chorus]
You say you're such a mess, I like the mess you make
Think you're too hard-headed, you're not that hard to take
When your puzzled heart's missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me, I'll love what's left of you

[Verse 2]
Oceans away, emotionally
Runnin' in place, lyin' awake
You say your past is gonna cut me
Yeah, I can take a little bleeding

[Chorus]
You say you're such a mess, I like the mess you make
Think you're too hard-headed, you're not that hard to take
When your puzzled heart's missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me, I'll love what's left of you
You say you're such a mess, I like the mess you make
Think you're too hard-headed, you're not that hard to take
When your puzzled heart's missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me, I'll love what's left of you

Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

I thought how, as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head:
“There is no peace on earth, ” I said
“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
“God is not dead, nor does he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.”You might also likeEmbed"

Do you remember?
When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel
So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always bе there right by your side
'Causе baby, you're always in my mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 2]
I never knew it would be possible
For you to be with me
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73
I was so jealous seeing you with him
Oh, baby, I know that I can treat you better back in those nights
Oh, you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh, baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine

I was on the aisle
Waiting for you, babe
Saw you in your gown
I was crying all my tears
I told myself that you are the one (You are the one)

Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
Summer nights, bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Calling you now, but you're not picking up
Shadows so close if that's still enough
Light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
So far away

[Verse 2]
It's breaking me, losing you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's still close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now
But somehow it still breaks my heart
We could have had this talk
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus]
So far away
So far away, oh
So far away
So far away

[Outro]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darlin' I will be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard
At twenty three
I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but grown and my memory fades
And the crowds don''t remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul
Could never grow old
It's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars (oh darlin')
Place your head on my beating heart

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
But now we're slipping at the edge
And holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Than why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

As my train rolls down the east coast I wonder how you keep warm

Too broken to move on

I wonder what these ladies really look like
Without their makeup and their purses and hairsprays
And I wonder what these fellows are really thinkin'
When they're flippin' through pages of magazines

[Chorus]
Now we're mannequins, just plastic, dolled-up remnants
Of the human race what people used to be
Because now everyone smells fake, it's all perfumes and body sprays
We're just plastic, dolled-up remnants of the human race what people used to be

[Verse 2]
And luxury shall soon become a weakness
We're growin' lazier and fatter every day
We're stagnant flowing in a sea of excess
Perfectly consumed with weekly pay

And we couldn't go a day without a Starbucks
Or a McDonald's or Walmart or Taco Bell
And we're always sure to hope for perfect conduct
Step outta line, that cop will come throw your ass in jail

Because now everyone smells fake, it's all perfumes and body sprays

I'll tell you it's a fucking disgrace

I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies

Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person

Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes

You try to explain, when you know you been crossed
So I'mma let the AK talk, like when a buster talk, South Memphis
Nigga what'cha fought? You scared to start a riot, keep that quiet
While I shout, I'm bout that paper player no doubt
When I run my mouth, just set me out

You like my baller so you borrowed it
I asked if you'll return it

While you say goodbye, oh

And the times you're with me just go easy

So I tried to call your number
Didn't care if you're asleep or still awake

Conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES
Including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket
And turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID

Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good
As you know, my plot to high-jack

EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES

We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet
Pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night
Fever
We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of
Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

Medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National
Health Services glasses

Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is
That perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies

Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to
A MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus

Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO
BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all
Start to twist to the music, including the Bobby

FREEZE FRAME - TECHNICOLOR BLUE TINT - TITLE CARD

(PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR                 FREEZE FRAMES À LA SWEET CHARITY.)

In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently
To be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area

One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a
Metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears
A see-through Mary Quant dress
AUSTIN
(taking photos)
Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout
For me baby.  Smashing!

We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in
The stewardess outfit foes on all fours

AUSTIN
Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
(beat)
No.  No

Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm
Spent

Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT
Scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground

AUSTIN
Get these off to Fab Magazine right

Austin, you've really outdone yourself
This time

AUSTIN
Thanks, baby

Face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention

But to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER
From behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They
Both crack up

Like to see that

Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded

Austin, why in God's name did you
Strike that woman?

AUSTIN
That ain't no woman!  It's a man
Man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's
Assassins

Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN
The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet

Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin
Hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington
Kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a
Head-lock from behind

AUSTIN
Where's Doctor Evil?

ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE

Gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from
His back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door
They give chase

Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair
A sign on the egg reads ""CRYOGENIC

FREEZING BEGINNING.""

No, he worked freelance, an
Internationally renowned swinging
Photographer by day and the ultimate
Gentlemen spy by night

Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His
Hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face
Suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His

Inner monologue?

I hope I didn't say that out loud
Just now

There is an uncomfortable SILENCE

VANESSA
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate
You to the Nineties.  You know, a
Lot's changed since 1967

AUSTIN
Well, as long as people are still
Having promiscuous sex with many
Anonymous partners without protection
While at the same time experimenting
With mind-expanding

Drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a

Day is spent reading wedding
Announcements in Farsi.  If I do
Well with this case, I finally get
Promoted to field operative...

AUSTIN
That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?

VANESSA
I beg your pardon?

AUSTIN
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

VANESSA
Excuse me?

AUSTIN
My wedding tackle.

VANESSA
I'm sorry?

AUSTIN
My meat and two veg

VANESSA
Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you
Must be a little confused, but we
Have a very serious situation at
Hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd
Concentrate on our mission and give
Your libido a rest

AUSTIN
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

VANESSA
A Chigro?

AUSTIN
You know, a Chigro&emdash; part
Chinese, part Negro&emdash; Chigro

VANESSA
(offended)
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore
It's considered offensive

AUSTIN
That's right.  You're supposed to
Say 'colored' now, right?
(spotting the flight
Attendants)
Here's the stewardesses!  Bring on
The sexy stews!

The STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily
One of them is a man and another wears braces

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?
We're called 'flight attendants'
Now, thank you very much

AUSTIN
Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a
Whore, I'm a sex worker', baby

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There
Are a few things we need to discuss
First of all, we're not wearing these

She holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

ALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY.  IT SAYS
HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 -

Everyone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'?

AUSTIN
Seems pretty straightforward, don't
You think...listen darling, I think
You're a fabulous bird.  Can I get
Your telephone number?

FLGHT ATTENDANT
(mock sexy)
Sure, it's easy to remember
(writing on his hand)
It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare
The craft for take-off now

AUSTIN
Smashing!  When we land I'll give
You a tinkle on the telling bone

The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits

AUSTIN
Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's
Two things I know about life: one
Americans will never take to soccer
Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses
Love to shag!

They're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa
And be honest

VANESSA
Sure

AUSTIN
Do I make you horny?

VANESSA
What?

AUSTIN
Do I make you horny?  Randy, you
Know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

VANESSA
I hope this is part of the unfreezing
Process

AUSTIN
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash;
That's what I do, I swing

VANESSA
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but
Let me be perfectly clear with you
Perhaps to the point of being
Insulting.  I will never have sex
With you, ever.  If you were the
Last man on Earth and I was the last
Woman on Earth, and the future of
The human race depended on our having
Sex simply for procreation, I still
Would not have sex with you

Austin is oblivious

AUSTIN
What's you point, Vanessa?

EXT.  PLANE IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

Austin's plane.  Time has passed

IINT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Vanessa's lap-top BEEPS

COMPUTER VOICE
You've got mail!

ANGLE ON:  the computer screen.  It's Basil Exposition

BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello Austin.  Hello Vanessa.  This
Is Basil Exposition, from British
Intelligence

There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think
May be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives
Gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's
The first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat
Rooms

AUSTIN
Thank you, Exposition

BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...

AUSTIN
Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful

Vanessa closes her lap-top

PILOT

Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning
Our final descent into Las Vegas
International Airport.  Flight
Attendants will be coming by to
Collect your drinks, and I'll ask
You at this time to please return to
The main cabin and put your

Bean-bags in the upright position

Austin and Vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags

EXT.  AIRPLANE LANDING - NIGHT

We see a plane's lights landing at night

ZOOM CUT TO:

INT.  PSYCHEDELIC SCENE BREAK

GRAPHIC:  The Trip Using a sequence of snap-zooms, colored
Projections, and flashing lights, we see Austin dance crazily

INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

DR. EVIL
(face again unseen)
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a
Long time, but I'm back.  It's all
Gone perfectly to plan except for
One small flaw.  Because of a
Technical error, my right arm was
Not frozen.  I was therefore by
Definition only partially frozen

ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty
Eyes darting left and right

MUSTAFA
But my design was perfect!  Your
Autonomic functions were shut down
And even though your arm wasn't
Frozen, the aging was retarded
Therefore your right arm is only
Slightly older than the left

DR. EVIL
Can't you see I'm only half a man?
Look at me, I'm a freak!

He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal

MUSTAFA
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do
Is&emdash;
(holding up tennis
Ball)
--work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze
It for twenty minutes a day.  A few
Months of that and it'll be just as
Strong as the other arm...

DR. EVIL
And look what you've done to Mr
Bigglesworth!

ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

Who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair
Around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself

MUSTAFA
We could not anticipate feline
Complications due to the reanimation
Process&emdash;

DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Silence!

ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he
Falls backwards into a pit

MUSTAFA
(blood-curdling scream)
Ahhhhhhhhh!

DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Let this be a reminder to you all
That this organization will not
Tolerate failure

MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY
FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS

Scar on his cheek

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, let's get down to business

More muffled SCREAMS

DR. EVIL
We've got a lot of work to do

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Someone help me!  I'm still alive
Only I'm very badly burned

DR. EVIL
(slightly distracted)
Some of you I know, some of you I'm
Meeting for the first time

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone
Call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a
Lot of pain

DR. EVIL
(very frustrated)
You've all been gathered here to
Form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me

He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
If somebody can open the retrieval
Hatch down here, I could get out
See, I designed this device myself
And...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you
Found me.  Listen, I'm very badly
Burned, so if you could just&emdash;
SFX:  Muffled Gunshot

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Ow!  You shot me!

DR. EVIL
Right.  Okay.  Moving on

MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
You shot me right in the arm!  Why
Did&emdash; SFX:  Muffled Gunshot
Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing

DR. EVIL
Let me go around the table and
Introduce everyone.  Frau
Farbissina...

ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA

DR. EVIL
...founder of the militant wing of
The Salvation Army.  Random Task...

RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform

DR. EVIL
...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman
Extraordinaire.  Show them what you
Do

He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.  It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room

DR. EVIL
Thank you, Random Task.  Patty
O'Brien...

PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes

DR. EVIL
...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark?

Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet

DR. EVIL
A superstitious man, he leaves a
Tiny keepsake on every victim he
Kills.  Scotland Yard would love to
Get their hands on that piece of
Evidence

PATTY O'BRIEN
(heavy Irish accent)
Yes, they're always after me lucky
Charms!

Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face

PATTY O'BRIEN
What?  What?  Why does everyone always
Laugh when I say that?  They are
After me lucky charms

They cannot contain their LAUGHTER

PATTY O'BRIEN
(angry)
What?

FRAU FARBISSINA
(through suppressed
Laughter)
It's a television commercial with
This little cartoon Leprechaun who
Is a benevolent imp who is very
Concerned that these children will
Steal his lucky charms which are
Foodstuffs fashioned into various
Shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers
What have you...
(pause)
It's a long story

DR. EVIL
Finally, I come to my number two
Man.  His name:  Number Two

NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch

DR. EVIL
For thirty years, Number Two has run
Virtucon, the legitimate face of my
Evil empire

He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to
Reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted
By various miniature models

NUMBER TWO
Over the last thirty years, Virtucon
Has grown by leaps and bounds.  About
Fifteen years ago, we changed from
Volatile chemicals to the
Communication industry.  We own cable companies in thirty-eight states...

The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map

NUMBER TWO
...in addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland...

A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland

NUMBER TWO
...Shipping in Texas...

A ship off the coast of Texas illuminates

NUMBER TWO
...Oil refineries in Seattle...

An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle

NUMBER TWO
And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.

The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago

NUMBER TWO
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors
(holds up plate)
Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.

DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called blackmail.  The Royal Family of
Britain are the wealthiest landowners In the world.  Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

There is an uncomfortable silence

NUMBER TWO
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did"

You know, recently, man
I hit the lowest point of my fuckin' life
I became consumed entirely
And went completely fuckin' insane
So, I figured: what else to do but to write about it?
Let it inspire me a bit
So, that's what I did
And now I got something to say

[Verse 1]
This is my real life, straight verses, no fuckin' chorus
So come explore it, love me for it, or judge me for it
I layed in bed, flickin' smokes in an open piss bottle
I dropped like twenty pounds in a week
Goin' through withdrawals
I always said addiction's a flaw of the weak
Obviously; my addiction, it was stronger than me
'Cause man, I hit rock bottom heavy, fuckin' hard
My mother said she found me convulsing
And held me in her arms
My love left me at my worst point, bailed when I fell
Last words to me, I should be ashamed of myself
That last week of my demise
The damn needles I took a thousand
Would you have come to my funeral and put me down then?
I almost died multiple times in a week
So how can you live with yourself
When you're tryin' to sleep?
To know I could be so close to dyin', lyin' in peace
Would you still just think of yourself if I was deceased?
And yeah, I got aggressive in my blackout state
And I ain't sayin' now that that's okay
We were so in love, romancin'
You refused to give me another chance then
What happened to your best quality, bein' understandin'?
I love you… you're hatin' me
It crushed me, then it bugged you
People judged you for datin' me
Now it's no forgiveness for a past side I've shown to women
With you, you know its different
You should stick to your own opinion
Our only time together on house arrest, hate this shit
There's supposed to be so much more to this relationship
Can't even look in a fuckin' mirror to see my face in it
I've sat in the dark with a knife to my throat; craziness
And still, you would try to mess with me
You really wanna push it, with my suicidal tendencies?
If I died, would you cry? Why are you and I enemies?
I press my palms into my eyes
And picture you beside me endlessly
You hated my females fans, so you were jealous, fuck it
You're the first I ever trusted, therefore fell in love with
You're perfect, I was just addicted to this hellish substance
You are correct though, I am completely self-destructive
And I'm sorry, it'd never happen again
My mind's gone for that span of time
Don't know what was happenin' then
If I was that crazy baby, I'd be glad I was dead
I'm sorry you said you felt like
You'd never see your family again
And I don't blame you, you were great, you should be proud
What I was goin' through, it's insane you could put me down
Exes that I've ruined and crushed
Have called to see I'm movin' up
When you ain't even asked me how I'm fuckin' doin' once
And I hear what you're sayin', close ear to the ground
When I needed you most, you nowhere to be found
If you really were my girl you would've been supportive
With true love it's true love, you shouldn't have to force it
'Cause I believed in you, my heart fuckin' bleeds for you
Where the fuck is your precense
When I really fuckin' needed you?
Towards the end, drugs removed my soul
I am embarrassed you were there to see me lose control
So, where you the love of my life, or just some stupid ho?
I guess now you're just somebody that I used to know
You might also like[Interlude]
For now, but I will be back
And I am across the country, bettering my life
I transferred my conditions here
And you know I'm bettering my life
And don't let people get inside your head
And convince you 'cause I'm such a fuckin' terrible person
That I must have been terrible to you, and tricked you
You know me as an amazing man
'Cause that's exactly what I was to you, straight up
I love you, I miss you
And now the whole world knows I'm sorry
And this one's for my dawg, man

[Verse 2]
As an ex addict, Bruce, when I met you
You was clean as a judge, no reason for drugs
And surrounded yourself with people you loved
When we first started to click, yeah, we partied a bit
Who knew we'd reach that point
Where it'd be harder and harder to quit?
The first night I met your brother keeps replayin' with me
The character I embodied was smooth, I was dangerous, see
The ""Genius On Drugs,"" so cool you was hangin' with me
He didn't know that I influenced you negatively
So when he seen us chillin', we was kings, he was proud
It breaks my heart to think of
What he probably thinks of me now
So with this I'm just reflectin', I'm constantly recollectin'
I got a younger brother too, Bruce, but you never met him
And he seen my darkness, said I don't got any good left
But even then he still wanna be followin' in my footsteps
And I betrayed 'em all, people who loved me to my core
My sister's always had my back—she doesn't anymore
So I look at my arm and the marks of needle penetration
'Cause the people who fuckin' love me
It leave 'em devastated
I guess we both got worse when you was outta control
But then I was sittin' in prison, bro, so how could I know?
And goin' through withdrawls in a prison cell, livin' hell
I know that feeling of pain
When you really wish you could kill yourself
I accepted it happened, be there a long time
They say every dog gets its day, I guess I got mine
I hit my house arrest, bail—lucky, I know
When we spoke some time later, it's been crushin' my soul
""I love you, Hollo,"" ""Bruce, I always got love for you, bro.""
That was the last thing I said as I fuckin' hung up the phone
Found out the next day, enraged, smashin' walls
Twenty-five, too young for a fuckin' man to fall
I wish I said somethin' more when you hadda called
A fuckin' hour later and you were dead in a bathroom stall
Why do we just enjoy it? Why do we love the posion?
You should've went out on a throne, bro, not a fuckin' toilet
My blood is boilin' at the thought of it, Bruce
You give yourself too much credit for how your tolerance grew? When you feelin' low on life
And needed that confidence boost
I'll take lines in your name
If they say it's what you wanted to do
And I never understood, but as of recent I knew
'Cause I was a needle or two away from bein' with you
And I'm sorry for the times that I was freakin' out
When you were with me, especially that time
I lost my mind while drivin' through the city
I wanted to honor your memory
And swear off, shootin' quickly
A year past, I'm still doin' the same shit—Bruce, forgive me!
I almost had my body into soft dirt
I swore I'd get better, but homie, it got a lot worse
And I was in that same weak place
So I couldn't fight for you; at your memorial
High on the same shit that took your life from you
I guess your father blamed me to people at the bar
I didn't hear it directly, it's like I seen it from a far
I told Whatevski there was somethin'
That I needed from his car
I cried for you, brother, and stuck another needle in my arm
I know, I know, it's fucked up, ain't it?
Friends don't know how to help, so that subject changes
""My parents is embarrassed"" is an understatement
It's just amazin' I can function with all the drugs I've taken
But yo, I'm gonna stop though, Bruce
I ain't ready to die yet, G
Through your friendship and your death, it's inspired me
I need to wake the fuck up now, man
Find my dreams, conquer goals
And become everything we said we'd try to be
The tat of your names on the ribs on my side
So to know I'll keep you close to my heart
That fills me with pride
And I know I'm not responsible, but I'm guilty inside

Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend

[Bridge]
When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine
And then I'll tell you why
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again
No one to face when I'm falling
Holding tight to dreams that never end

[Chorus 1]
I'll be you, I do, I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyone's reason, everything dying and leaving

[Post-Chorus 1]
Out with these faults and you make me a baby
Faking a movement by no one seeing it
No one always finds peace flung
No one chooses to beat my pride down

[Verse 2]
Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up
Somewhat to fate accumulates
Loving pain to be clung to

[Chorus 2]
By luminous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong and true to us
Out of place in my own time, drowning thinking that I'm dry
You might also like[Post-Chorus 2]
Holding on to facts that will never be proven
Faking an action 'cause no one is looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feel nothing when my life flashes before my eyes

She's sitting at the table, the hours get later
He was supposed to be here
She's sure he would have called
She waits a little longer, there's no one in the driveway
No one's said they've seen him
Why is something wrong?
She looks back to the window, suddenly the phone rings
A voice says something's happened
That she should come right now
Her mind goes to December, she thinks of when he asked her
He bent down on his knees first
And he said

[Chorus]
I want you forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, forever and always

[Verse 2]
She pulls up to the entrance, she walks right to the front desk
They lead her down a million halls
A maze that's never-ending
They talk about what happened but she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face
As she walks into the room
She sits by his bedside, holds his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have and the good life
The house on the hillside
Where they would stay
You might also like[Chorus]
Stay there forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, and always remember
Whether rich or for poor, or for better
We'll still love each other, forever and always

[Bridge]
Then she gets an idea and calls in the nurses
Brings up the chaplain and he says a couple verses
She borrows some rings from the couple next door
Everybody's laughing as the tears fall on the floor
She looks into his eyes, and she says

[Chorus]
I want you forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, and always remember
Whether happy or sad or whatever
We'll still love each other, forever and always
Forever and always, forever and always

[Outro]
She finishes the vows but the beeps are getting too slow
His voice is almost too low
As he says, ""I love you forever, forever and always
Please just remember even if I'm not there
I'll always love you, forever and always""16Embed"

""I've been here for the last two hours; you don't know what a state I have been in all day.""

""I know, I know. But to business. Do you know why I have come? Not to talk nonsense, as I did yesterday. I tell you what, we must behave more sensibly in future. I thought a great deal about it last night.""

""In what way—in what must we be more sensible? I am ready for my part; but, really, nothing more sensible has happened to me in my life than this, now.""

""Really? In the first place, I beg you not to squeeze my hands so; secondly, I must tell you that I spent a long time thinking about you and feeling doubtful to-day.""

""And how did it end?""

""How did it end? The upshot of it is that we must begin all over again, because the conclusion I reached to-day was that I don't know you at all; that I behaved like a baby last night, like a little girl; and, of course, the fact of it is, that it's my soft heart that is to blame—that is, I sang my own praises, as one always does in the end when one analyses one's conduct. And therefore to correct my mistake, I've made up my mind to find out all about you minutely. But as I have no one from whom I can find out anything, you must tell me everything fully yourself. Well, what sort of man are you? Come, make haste—begin—tell me your whole history.""

""My history!"" I cried in alarm. ""My history! But who has told you I have a history? I have no history....""

""Then how have you lived, if you have no history?"" she interrupted, laughing.

""Absolutely without any history! I have lived, as they say, keeping myself to myself, that is, utterly alone—alone, entirely alone. Do you know what it means to be alone?""

""But how alone? Do you mean you never saw any one?""

""Oh no, I see people, of course; but still I am alone.""

""Why, do you never talk to any one?""
""Strictly speaking, with no one.""

""Who are you then? Explain yourself! Stay, I guess: most likely, like me you have a grandmother. She is blind and will never let me go anywhere, so that I have almost forgotten how to talk; and when I played some pranks two years ago, and she saw there was no holding me in, she called me up and pinned my dress to hers, and ever since we sit like that for days together; she knits a stocking, though she's blind, and I sit beside her, sew or read aloud to her—it's such a queer habit, here for two years I've been pinned to her....""

""Good Heavens! what misery! But no, I haven't a grandmother like that.""

""Well, if you haven't why do you sit at home?...""

""Listen, do you want to know the sort of man I am?""

""Yes, yes!""

""In the strict sense of the word?""

""In the very strictest sense of the word.""

""Very well, I am a type!""

""Type, type! What sort of type?"" cried the girl, laughing, as though she had not had a chance of laughing for a whole year. ""Yes, it's very amusing talking to you. Look, here's a seat, let us sit down. No one is passing here, no one will hear us, and—begin your history. For it's no good your telling me, I know you have a history; only you are concealing it. To begin with, what is a type?""

""A type? A type is an original, it's an absurd person!"" I said, infected by her childish laughter. ""It's a character. Listen; do you know what is meant by a dreamer?""

""A dreamer! Indeed I should think I do know. I am a dreamer myself. Sometimes, as I sit by grandmother, all sorts of things come into my head. Why, when one begins dreaming one lets one's fancy run away with one—why, I marry a Chinese Prince!... Though sometimes it is a good thing to dream! But, goodness knows! Especially when one has something to think of apart from dreams,"" added the girl, this time rather seriously.

""Excellent! If you have been married to a Chinese Emperor, you will quite understand me. Come, listen.... But one minute, I don't know your name yet.""
""At last! You have been in no hurry to think of it!""

""Oh, my goodness! It never entered my head, I felt quite happy as it was....""

""My name is Nastenka.""

""Nastenka! And nothing else?""

""Nothing else! Why, is not that enough for you, you insatiable person?""

""Not enough? On the contrary, it's a great deal, a very great deal, Nastenka; you kind girl, if you are Nastenka for me from the first.""

""Quite so! Well?""

""Well, listen, Nastenka, now for this absurd history.""

I sat down beside her, assumed a pedantically serious attitude, and began as though reading from a manuscript:—

""There are, Nastenka, though you may not know it, strange nooks in Petersburg. It seems as though the same sun as shines for all Petersburg people does not peep into those spots, but some other different new one, bespoken expressly for those nooks, and it throws a different light on everything. In these corners, dear Nastenka, quite a different life is lived, quite unlike the life that is surging round us, but such as perhaps exists in some unknown realm, not among us in our serious, over-serious, time. Well, that life is a mixture of something purely fantastic, fervently ideal, with something (alas! Nastenka) dingily prosaic and ordinary, not to say incredibly vulgar.""

""Foo! Good Heavens! What a preface! What do I hear?""

""Listen, Nastenka. (It seems to me I shall never be tired of calling you Nastenka.) Let me tell you that in these corners live strange people—dreamers. The dreamer—if you want an exact definition—is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort. For the most part he settles in some inaccessible corner, as though hiding from the light of day; once he slips into his corner, he grows to it like a snail, or, anyway, he is in that respect very much like that remarkable creature, which is an animal and a house both at once, and is called a tortoise. Why do you suppose he is so fond of his four walls, which are invariably painted green, grimy, dismal and reeking unpardonably of tobacco smoke? Why is it that when this absurd gentleman is visited by one of his few acquaintances (and he ends by getting rid of all his friends), why does this absurd person meet him with such embarrassment, changing countenance and overcome with confusion, as though he had only just committed some crime within his four walls; as though he had been forging counterfeit notes, or as though he were writing verses to be sent to a journal with an anonymous letter, in which he states that the real poet is dead, and that his friend thinks it his sacred duty to publish his things? Why, tell me, Nastenka, why is it conversation is not easy between the two friends? Why is there no laughter? Why does no lively word fly from the tongue of the perplexed newcomer, who at other times may be very fond of laughter, lively words, conversation about the fair sex, and other cheerful subjects? And why does this friend, probably a new friend and on his first visit—for there will hardly be a second, and the friend will never come again—why is the friend himself so confused, so tongue-tied, in spite of his wit (if he has any), as he looks at the downcast face of his host, who in his turn becomes utterly helpless and at his wits' end after gigantic but fruitless efforts to smooth things over and enliven the conversation, to show his knowledge of polite society, to talk, too, of the fair sex, and by such humble endeavour, to please the poor man, who like a fish out of water has mistakenly come to visit him? Why does the gentleman, all at once remembering some very necessary business which never existed, suddenly seize his hat and hurriedly make off, snatching away his hand from the warm grip of his host, who was trying his utmost to show his regret and retrieve the lost position? Why does the friend chuckle as he goes out of the door, and swear never to come and see this queer creature again, though the queer creature is really a very good fellow, and at the same time he cannot refuse his imagination the little diversion of comparing the queer fellow's countenance during their conversation with the expression of an unhappy kitten treacherously captured, roughly handled, frightened and subjected to all sorts of indignities by children, till, utterly crestfallen, it hides away from them under a chair in the dark, and there must needs at its leisure bristle up, spit, and wash its insulted face with both paws, and long afterwards look angrily at life and nature, and even at the bits saved from the master's dinner for it by the sympathetic housekeeper?""

""Listen,"" interrupted Nastenka, who had listened to me all the time in amazement, opening her eyes and her little mouth. ""Listen; I don't know in the least why it happened and why you ask me such absurd questions; all I know is, that this adventure must have happened word for word to you.""
""Doubtless,"" I answered, with the gravest face.

""Well, since there is no doubt about it, go on,"" said Nastenka, ""because I want very much to know how it will end.""

""You want to know, Nastenka, what our hero, that is I—for the hero of the whole business was my humble self—did in his corner? You want to know why I lost my head and was upset for the whole day by the unexpected visit of a friend? You want to know why I was so startled, why I blushed when the door of my room was opened, why I was not able to entertain my visitor, and why I was crushed under the weight of my own hospitality?""

""Why, yes, yes,"" answered Nastenka, ""that's the point. Listen. You describe it all splendidly, but couldn't you perhaps describe it a little less splendidly? You talk as though you were reading it out of a book.""

""Nastenka,"" I answered in a stern and dignified voice, hardly able to keep from laughing, ""dear Nastenka, I know I describe splendidly, but, excuse me, I don't know how else to do it. At this moment, dear Nastenka, at this moment I am like the spirit of King Solomon when, after lying a thousand years under seven seals in his urn, those seven seals were at last taken off. At this moment, Nastenka, when we have met at last after such a long separation—for I have known you for ages, Nastenka, because I have been looking for some one for ages, and that is a sign that it was you I was looking for, and it was ordained that we should meet now—at this moment a thousand valves have opened in my head, and I must let myself flow in a river of words, or I shall choke. And so I beg you not to interrupt me, Nastenka, but listen humbly and obediently, or I will be silent.""

""No, no, no! Not at all. Go on! I won't say a word!""

""I will continue. There is, my friend Nastenka, one hour in my day which I like extremely. That is the hour when almost all business, work and duties are over, and every one is hurrying home to dinner, to lie down, to rest, and on the way all are cogitating on other more cheerful subjects relating to their evenings, their nights, and all the rest of their free time. At that hour our hero—for allow me, Nastenka, to tell my story in the third person, for one feels awfully ashamed to tell it in the first person—and so at that hour our hero, who had his work too, was pacing along after the others. But a strange feeling of pleasure set his pale, rather crumpled-looking face working. He looked not with indifference on the evening glow which was slowly fading on the cold Petersburg sky. When I say he looked, I am lying: he did not look at it, but saw it as it were without realizing, as though tired or preoccupied with some other more interesting subject, so that he could scarcely spare a glance for anything about him. He was pleased because till next day he was released from business irksome to him, and happy as a schoolboy let out from the class-room to his games and mischief. Take a look at him, Nastenka; you will see at once that joyful emotion has already had an effect on his weak nerves and morbidly excited fancy. You see he is thinking of something.... Of dinner, do you imagine? Of the evening? What is he looking at like that? Is it at that gentleman of dignified appearance who is bowing so picturesquely to the lady who rolls by in a carriage drawn by prancing horses? No, Nastenka; what are all those trivialities to him now! He is rich now with his own individual life; he has suddenly become rich, and it is not for nothing that the fading sunset sheds its farewell gleams so gaily before him, and calls forth a swarm of impressions from his warmed heart. Now he hardly notices the road, on which the tiniest details at other times would strike him. Now 'the Goddess of Fancy' (if you have read Zhukovsky, dear Nastenka) has already with fantastic hand spun her golden warp and begun weaving upon it patterns of marvellous magic life—and who knows, maybe, her fantastic hand has borne him to the seventh crystal heaven far from the excellent granite pavement on which he was walking his way? Try stopping him now, ask him suddenly where he is standing now, through what streets he is going—he will, probably remember nothing, neither where he is going nor where he is standing now, and flushing with vexation he will certainly tell some lie to save appearances. That is why he starts, almost cries out, and looks round with horror when a respectable old lady stops him politely in the middle of the pavement and asks her way. Frowning with vexation he strides on, scarcely noticing that more than one passer-by smiles and turns round to look after him, and that a little girl, moving out of his way in alarm, laughs aloud, gazing open-eyed at his broad meditative smile and gesticulations. But fancy catches up in its playful flight the old woman, the curious passers-by, and the laughing child, and the peasants spending their nights in their barges on Fontanka (our hero, let us suppose, is walking along the canal-side at that moment), and capriciously weaves every one and everything into the canvas like a fly in a spider's web. And it is only after the queer fellow has returned to his comfortable den with fresh stores for his mind to work on, has sat down and finished his dinner, that he comes to himself, when Matrona who waits upon him—always thoughtful and depressed—clears the table and gives him his pipe; he comes to himself then and recalls with surprise that he has dined, though he has absolutely no notion how it has happened. It has grown dark in the room; his soul is sad and empty; the whole kingdom of fancies drops to pieces about him, drops to pieces without a trace, without a sound, floats away like a dream, and he cannot himself remember what he was dreaming. But a vague sensation faintly stirs his heart and sets it aching, some new desire temptingly tickles and excites his fancy, and imperceptibly evokes a swarm of fresh phantoms. Stillness reigns in the little room; imagination is fostered by solitude and idleness; it is faintly smouldering, faintly simmering, like the water with which old Matrona is making her coffee as she moves quietly about in the kitchen close by. Now it breaks out spasmodically; and the book, picked up aimlessly and at random, drops from my dreamer's hand before he has reached the third page. His imagination is again stirred and at work, and again a new world, a new fascinating life opens vistas before him. A fresh dream—fresh happiness! A fresh rush of delicate, voluptuous poison! What is real life to him! To his corrupted eyes we live, you and I, Nastenka, so torpidly, slowly, insipidly; in his eyes we are all so dissatisfied with our fate, so exhausted by our life! And, truly, see how at first sight everything is cold, morose, as though ill-humoured among us.... Poor things! thinks our dreamer. And it is no wonder that he thinks it! Look at these magic phantasms, which so enchantingly, so whimsically, so carelessly and freely group before him in such a magic, animated picture, in which the most prominent figure in the foreground is of course himself, our dreamer, in his precious person. See what varied adventures, what an endless swarm of ecstatic dreams. You ask, perhaps, what he is dreaming of. Why ask that?—why, of everything ... of the lot of the poet, first unrecognized, then crowned with laurels; of friendship with Hoffmann, St. Bartholomew's Night, of Diana Vernon, of playing the hero at the taking of Kazan by Ivan Vassilyevitch, of Clara Mowbray, of Effie Deans, of the council of the prelates and Huss before them, of the rising of the dead in 'Robert the Devil' (do you remember the music, it smells of the churchyard!), of Minna and Brenda, of the battle of Berezina, of the reading of a poem at Countess V. D.'s, of Danton, of Cleopatra ei suoi amanti, of a little house in Kolomna, of a little home of one's own and beside one a dear creature who listens to one on a winter's evening, opening her little mouth and eyes as you are listening to me now, my angel.... No, Nastenka, what is there, what is there for him, voluptuous sluggard, in this life, for which you and I have such a longing? He thinks that this is a poor pitiful life, not foreseeing that for him too, maybe, sometime the mournful hour may strike, when for one day of that pitiful life he would give all his years of phantasy, and would give them not only for joy and for happiness, but without caring to make distinctions in that hour of sadness, remorse and unchecked grief. But so far that threatening has not arrived—he desires nothing, because he is superior to all desire, because he has everything, because he is satiated, because he is the artist of his own life, and creates it for himself every hour to suit his latest whim. And you know this fantastic world of fairyland is so easily, so naturally created! As though it were not a delusion! Indeed, he is ready to believe at some moments that all this life is not suggested by feeling, is not mirage, not a delusion of the imagination, but that it is concrete, real, substantial! Why is it, Nastenka, why is it at such moments one holds one's breath? Why, by what sorcery, through what incomprehensible caprice, is the pulse quickened, does a tear start from the dreamer's eye, while his pale moist cheeks glow, while his whole being is suffused with an inexpressible sense of consolation? Why is it that whole sleepless nights pass like a flash in inexhaustible gladness and happiness, and when the dawn gleams rosy at the window and daybreak floods the gloomy room with uncertain, fantastic light, as in Petersburg, our dreamer, worn out and exhausted, flings himself on his bed and drops asleep with thrills of delight in his morbidly overwrought spirit, and with a weary sweet ache in his heart? Yes, Nastenka, one deceives oneself and unconsciously believes that real true passion is stirring one's soul; one unconsciously believes that there is something living, tangible in one's immaterial dreams! And is it delusion? Here love, for instance, is bound up with all its fathomless joy, all its torturing agonies in his bosom.... Only look at him, and you will be convinced! Would you believe, looking at him, dear Nastenka, that he has never known her whom he loves in his ecstatic dreams? Can it be that he has only seen her in seductive visions, and that this passion has been nothing but a dream? Surely they must have spent years hand in hand together—alone the two of them, casting off all the world and each uniting his or her life with the other's? Surely when the hour of parting came she must have lain sobbing and grieving on his bosom, heedless of the tempest raging under the sullen sky, heedless of the wind which snatches and bears away the tears from her black eyelashes? Can all of that have been a dream—and that garden, dejected, forsaken, run wild, with its little moss-grown paths, solitary, gloomy, where they used to walk so happily together, where they hoped, grieved, loved, loved each other so long, ""so long and so fondly?"" And that queer ancestral house where she spent so many years lonely and sad with her morose old husband, always silent and splenetic, who frightened them, while timid as children they hid their love from each other? What torments they suffered, what agonies of terror, how innocent, how pure was their love, and how (I need hardly say, Nastenka) malicious people were! And, good Heavens! surely he met her afterwards, far from their native shores, under alien skies, in the hot south in the divinely eternal city, in the dazzling splendour of the ball to the crash of music, in a palazzo (it must be in a palazzo), drowned in a sea of lights, on the balcony, wreathed in myrtle and roses, where, recognizing him, she hurriedly removes her mask and whispering, 'I am free,' flings herself trembling into his arms, and with a cry of rapture, clinging to one another, in one instant they forget their sorrow and their parting and all their agonies, and the gloomy house and the old man and the dismal garden in that distant land, and the seat on which with a last passionate kiss she tore herself away from his arms numb with anguish and despair.... Oh, Nastenka, you must admit that one would start, betray confusion, and blush like a schoolboy who has just stuffed in his pocket an apple stolen from a neighbour's garden, when your uninvited visitor, some stalwart, lanky fellow, a festive soul fond of a joke, opens your door and shouts out as though nothing were happening: 'My dear boy, I have this minute come from Pavlovsk.' My goodness! the old count is dead, unutterable happiness is close at hand—and people arrive from Pavlovsk!""

Finishing my pathetic appeal, I paused pathetically. I remembered that I had an intense desire to force myself to laugh, for I was already feeling that a malignant demon was stirring within me, that there was a lump in my throat, that my chin was beginning to twitch, and that my eyes were growing more and more moist.

I expected Nastenka, who listened to me opening her clever eyes, would break into her childish, irrepressible laugh; and I was already regretting that I had gone so far, that I had unnecessarily described what had long been simmering in my heart, about which I could speak as though from a written account of it, because I had long ago passed judgment on myself and now could not resist reading it, making my confession, without expecting to be understood; but to my surprise she was silent, waiting a little, then she faintly pressed my hand and with timid sympathy asked—

""Surely you haven't lived like that all your life?""

""All my life, Nastenka,"" I answered; ""all my life, and it seems to me I shall go on so to the end.""

""No, that won't do,"" she said uneasily, ""that must not be; and so, maybe, I shall spend all my life beside grandmother. Do you know, it is not at all good to live like that?""

""I know, Nastenka, I know!"" I cried, unable to restrain my feelings longer. ""And I realize now, more than ever, that I have lost all my best years! And now I know it and feel it more painfully from recognizing that God has sent me you, my good angel, to tell me that and show it. Now that I sit beside you and talk to you it is strange for me to think of the future, for in the future—there is loneliness again, again this musty, useless life; and what shall I have to dream of when I have been so happy in reality beside you! Oh, may you be blessed, dear girl, for not having repulsed me at first, for enabling me to say that for two evenings, at least, I have lived.""

""Oh, no, no!"" cried Nastenka and tears glistened in her eyes. ""No, it mustn't be so any more; we must not part like that! what are two evenings?""

""Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka! Do you know how far you have reconciled me to myself? Do you know now that I shall not think so ill of myself, as I have at some moments? Do you know that, maybe, I shall leave off grieving over the crime and sin of my life? for such a life is a crime and a sin. And do not imagine that I have been exaggerating anything—for goodness' sake don't think that, Nastenka: for at times such misery comes over me, such misery.... Because it begins to seem to me at such times that I am incapable of beginning a life in real life, because it has seemed to me that I have lost all touch, all instinct for the actual, the real; because at last I have cursed myself; because after my fantastic nights I have moments of returning sobriety, which are awful! Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in the vortex of life around you; you hear, you see, men living in reality; you see that life for them is not forbidden, that their life does not float away like a dream, like a vision; that their life is being eternally renewed, eternally youthful, and not one hour of it is the same as another; while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared, the slave of shadows, of the idea, the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun, and overcasts with depression the true Petersburg heart so devoted to the sun—and what is fancy in depression! One feels that this inexhaustible fancy is weary at last and worn out with continual exercise, because one is growing into manhood, outgrowing one's old ideals: they are being shattered into fragments, into dust; if there is no other life one must build one up from the fragments. And meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else! And in vain the dreamer rakes over his old dreams, as though seeking a spark among the embers, to fan them into flame, to warm his chilled heart by the rekindled fire, and to rouse up in it again all that was so sweet, that touched his heart, that set his blood boiling, drew tears from his eyes, and so luxuriously deceived him! Do you know, Nastenka, the point I have reached? Do you know that I am forced now to celebrate the anniversary of my own sensations, the anniversary of that which was once so sweet, which never existed in reality—for this anniversary is kept in memory of those same foolish, shadowy dreams—and to do this because those foolish dreams are no more, because I have nothing to earn them with; you know even dreams do not come for nothing! Do you know that I love now to recall and visit at certain dates the places where I was once happy in my own way? I love to build up my present in harmony with the irrevocable past, and I often wander like a shadow, aimless, sad and dejected, about the streets and crooked lanes of Petersburg. What memories they are! To remember, for instance, that here just a year ago, just at this time, at this hour, on this pavement, I wandered just as lonely, just as dejected as to-day. And one remembers that then one's dreams were sad, and though the past was no better one feels as though it had somehow been better, and that life was more peaceful, that one was free from the black thoughts that haunt one now; that one was free from the gnawing of conscience—the gloomy, sullen gnawing which now gives me no rest by day or by night. And one asks oneself where are one's dreams. And one shakes one's head and says how rapidly the years fly by! And again one asks oneself what has one done with one's years. Where have you buried your best days? Have you lived or not? Look, one says to oneself, look how cold the world is growing. Some more years will pass, and after them will come gloomy solitude; then will come old age trembling on its crutch, and after it misery and desolation. Your fantastic world will grow pale, your dreams will fade and die and will fall like the yellow leaves from the trees.... Oh, Nastenka! you know it will be sad to be left alone, utterly alone, and to have not even anything to regret—nothing, absolutely nothing ... for all that you have lost, all that, all was nothing, stupid, simple nullity, there has been nothing but dreams!""

""Come, don't work on my feelings any more,"" said Nastenka, wiping away a tear which was trickling down her cheek. ""Now it's over! Now we shall be two together. Now, whatever happens to me, we will never part. Listen; I am a simple girl, I have not had much education, though grandmother did get a teacher for me, but truly I understand you, for all that you have described I have been through myself, when grandmother pinned me to her dress. Of course, I should not have described it so well as you have; I am not educated,"" she added timidly, for she was still feeling a sort of respect for my pathetic eloquence and lofty style; ""but I am very glad that you have been quite open with me. Now I know you thoroughly, all of you. And do you know what? I want to tell you my history too, all without concealment, and after that you must give me advice. You are a very clever man; will you promise to give me advice?""

""Ah, Nastenka,"" I cried, ""though I have never given advice, still less sensible advice, yet I see now that if we always go on like this that it will be very sensible, and that each of us will give the other a great deal of sensible advice! Well, my pretty Nastenka, what sort of advice do you want? Tell me frankly; at this moment I am so gay and happy, so bold and sensible, that it won't be difficult for me to find words.""

""No, no!"" Nastenka interrupted, laughing. ""I don't only want sensible advice, I want warm brotherly advice, as though you had been fond of me all your life!""

""Agreed, Nastenka, agreed!"" I cried delighted; ""and if I had been fond of you for twenty years, I couldn't have been fonder of you than I am now.""

""Your hand,"" said Nastenka.

""Here it is,"" said I, giving her my hand.

""And so let us begin my history!""

                                        Nastenka's History

""Half my story you know already—that is, you know that I have an old grandmother....""

""If the other half is as brief as that ..."" I interrupted, laughing.

""Be quiet and listen. First of all you must agree not to interrupt me, or else, perhaps I shall get in a muddle! Come, listen quietly.

""I have an old grandmother. I came into her hands when I was quite a little girl, for my father and mother are dead. It must be supposed that grandmother was once richer, for now she recalls better days. She taught me French, and then got a teacher for me. When I was fifteen (and now I am seventeen) we gave up having lessons. It was at that time that I got into mischief; what I did I won't tell you; it's enough to say that it wasn't very important. But grandmother called me to her one morning and said that as she was blind she could not look after me; she took a pin and pinned my dress to hers, and said that we should sit like that for the rest of our lives if, of course, I did not become a better girl. In fact, at first it was impossible to get away from her: I had to work, to read and to study all beside grandmother. I tried to deceive her once, and persuaded Fekla to sit in my place. Fekla is our charwoman, she is deaf. Fekla sat there instead of me; grandmother was asleep in her armchair at the time, and I went off to see a friend close by. Well, it ended in trouble. Grandmother woke up while I was out, and asked some questions; she thought I was still sitting quietly in my place. Fekla saw that grandmother was asking her something, but could not tell what it was; she wondered what to do, undid the pin and ran away....""

At this point Nastenka stopped and began laughing. I laughed with her. She left off at once.

""I tell you what, don't you laugh at grandmother. I laugh because it's funny.... What can I do, since grandmother is like that; but yet I am fond of her in a way. Oh, well, I did catch it that time. I had to sit down in my place at once, and after that I was not allowed to stir.

""Oh, I forgot to tell you that our house belongs to us, that is to grandmother; it is a little wooden house with three windows as old as grandmother herself, with a little upper storey; well, there moved into our upper storey a new lodger.""

""Then you had an old lodger,"" I observed casually.

""Yes, of course,"" answered Nastenka, ""and one who knew how to hold his tongue better than you do. In fact, he hardly ever used his tongue at all. He was a dumb, blind, lame, dried-up little old man, so that at last he could not go on living, he died; so then we had to find a new lodger, for we could not live without a lodger—the rent, together with grandmother's pension, is almost all we have. But the new lodger, as luck would have it, was a young man, a stranger not of these parts. As he did not haggle over the rent, grandmother accepted him, and only afterwards she asked me: 'Tell me, Nastenka, what is our lodger like—is he young or old?' I did not want to lie, so I told grandmother that he wasn't exactly young and that he wasn't old.

""'And is he pleasant looking?' asked grandmother.

""Again I did not want to tell a lie: 'Yes, he is pleasant looking, grandmother,' I said. And grandmother said: 'Oh, what a nuisance, what a nuisance! I te"

Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day
Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun
Up to the people: thither flocked at noon
His tenants, wife and child, and thither half
The neighbouring borough with their Institute
Of which he was the patron. I was there
From college, visiting the son,--the son
A Walter too,--with others of our set,
Five others: we were seven at Vivian-place.

And me that morning Walter showed the house,
Greek, set with busts: from vases in the hall
Flowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,
Grew side by side; and on the pavement lay
Carved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,
Huge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;
And on the tables every clime and age
Jumbled together; celts and calumets,
Claymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans
Of sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,
Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,
The cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs
From the isles of palm: and higher on the walls,
Betwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,
His own forefathers' arms and armour hung.
And 'this' he said 'was Hugh's at Agincourt;
And that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon:
A good knight he! we keep a chronicle
With all about him'--which he brought, and I
Dived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,
Half-legend, half-historic, counts and kings
Who laid about them at their wills and died;
And mixt with these, a lady, one that armed
Her own fair head, and sallying through the gate,
Had beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.

'O miracle of women,' said the book,
'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged
By this wild king to force her to his wish,
Nor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier's death,
But now when all was lost or seemed as lost--
Her stature more than mortal in the burst
Of sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--
Brake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,
And, falling on them like a thunderbolt,
She trampled some beneath her horses' heels,
And some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,
And some were pushed with lances from the rock,
And part were drowned within the whirling brook:
O miracle of noble womanhood!'
So sang the gallant glorious chronicle;
And, I all rapt in this, 'Come out,' he said,
'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth
And sister Lilia with the rest.' We went
(I kept the book and had my finger in it)
Down through the park: strange was the sight to me;
For all the sloping pasture murmured, sown
With happy faces and with holiday.
There moved the multitude, a thousand heads:
The patient leaders of their Institute
Taught them with facts. One reared a font of stone
And drew, from butts of water on the slope,
The fountain of the moment, playing, now
A twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,
Or steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball
Danced like a wisp: and somewhat lower down
A man with knobs and wires and vials fired
A cannon: Echo answered in her sleep
From hollow fields: and here were telescopes
For azure views; and there a group of girls
In circle waited, whom the electric shock
Dislinked with shrieks and laughter: round the lake
A little clock-work steamer paddling plied
And shook the lilies: perched about the knolls
A dozen angry models jetted steam:
A petty railway ran: a fire-balloon
Rose gem-like up before the dusky groves
And dropt a fairy parachute and past:
And there through twenty posts of telegraph
They flashed a saucy message to and fro
Between the mimic stations; so that sport
Went hand in hand with Science; otherwhere
Pure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled
And stumped the wicket; babies rolled about
Like tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids
Arranged a country dance, and flew through light
And shadow, while the twangling violin
Struck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead
The broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime
Made noise with bees and breeze from end to end.
Strange was the sight and smacking of the time;
And long we gazed, but satiated at length
Came to the ruins. High-arched and ivy-claspt,
Of finest Gothic lighter than a fire,
Through one wide chasm of time and frost they gave
The park, the crowd, the house; but all within
The sward was trim as any garden lawn:
And here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,
And Lilia with the rest, and lady friends
From neighbour seats: and there was Ralph himself,
A broken statue propt against the wall,
As gay as any. Lilia, wild with sport,
Half child half woman as she was, had wound
A scarf of orange round the stony helm,
And robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,
That made the old warrior from his ivied nook
Glow like a sunbeam: near his tomb a feast
Shone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,
And there we joined them: then the maiden Aunt
Took this fair day for text, and from it preached
An universal culture for the crowd,
And all things great; but we, unworthier, told
Of college: he had climbed across the spikes,
And he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,
And he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one
Discussed his tutor, rough to common men,
But honeying at the whisper of a lord;
And one the Master, as a rogue in grain
Veneered with sanctimonious theory.
But while they talked, above their heads I saw
The feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought
My book to mind: and opening this I read
Of old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang
With tilt and tourney; then the tale of her
That drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,
And much I praised her nobleness, and 'Where,'
Asked Walter, patting Lilia's head (she lay
Beside him) 'lives there such a woman now?'

Quick answered Lilia 'There are thousands now
Such women, but convention beats them down:
It is but bringing up; no more than that:
You men have done it: how I hate you all!
Ah, were I something great! I wish I were
Some might poetess, I would shame you then,
That love to keep us children! O I wish
That I were some great princess, I would build
Far off from men a college like a man's,
And I would teach them all that men are taught;
We are twice as quick!' And here she shook aside
The hand that played the patron with her curls.

And one said smiling 'Pretty were the sight
If our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt
With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,
And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.
I think they should not wear our rusty gowns,
But move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph
Who shines so in the corner; yet I fear,
If there were many Lilias in the brood,
However deep you might embower the nest,
Some boy would spy it.'
At this upon the sward
She tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:
'That's your light way; but I would make it death
For any male thing but to peep at us.'

Petulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;
A rosebud set with little wilful thorns,
And sweet as English air could make her, she:
But Walter hailed a score of names upon her,
And 'petty Ogress', and 'ungrateful Puss',
And swore he longed at college, only longed,
All else was well, for she-society.
They boated and they cricketed; they talked
At wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;
They lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;
They rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,
And caught the blossom of the flying terms,
But missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,
The little hearth-flower Lilia. Thus he spoke,
Part banter, part affection.
'True,' she said,
'We doubt not that. O yes, you missed us much.
I'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.'

She held it out; and as a parrot turns
Up through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,
And takes a lady's finger with all care,
And bites it for true heart and not for harm,
So he with Lilia's. Daintily she shrieked
And wrung it. 'Doubt my word again!' he said.
'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:
We seven stayed at Christmas up to read;
And there we took one tutor as to read:
The hard-grained Muses of the cube and square
Were out of season: never man, I think,
So mouldered in a sinecure as he:
For while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,
And our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,
We did but talk you over, pledge you all
In wassail; often, like as many girls--
Sick for the hollies and the yews of home--
As many little trifling Lilias--played
Charades and riddles as at Christmas here,
And ~what's my thought~ and ~when~ and ~where~ and ~how~,
As here at Christmas.'
She remembered that:
A pleasant game, she thought: she liked it more
Than magic music, forfeits, all the rest.
But these--what kind of tales did men tell men,
She wondered, by themselves?
A half-disdain
Perched on the pouted blossom of her lips:
And Walter nodded at me; '~He~ began,
The rest would follow, each in turn; and so
We forged a sevenfold story. Kind? what kind?
Chimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,
Seven-headed monsters only made to kill
Time by the fire in winter.'
'Kill him now,
The tyrant! kill him in the summer too,'
Said Lilia; 'Why not now?' the maiden Aunt.
'Why not a summer's as a winter's tale?
A tale for summer as befits the time,
And something it should be to suit the place,
Heroic, for a hero lies beneath,
Grave, solemn!'
Walter warped his mouth at this
To something so mock-solemn, that I laughed
And Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth
An echo like a ghostly woodpecker,
Hid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt
(A little sense of wrong had touched her face
With colour) turned to me with 'As you will;
Heroic if you will, or what you will,
Or be yourself you hero if you will.'

'Take Lilia, then, for heroine' clamoured he,
'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,
Grand, epic, homicidal; and be you
The Prince to win her!'
'Then follow me, the Prince,'
I answered, 'each be hero in his turn!
Seven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--
Heroic seems our Princess as required--
But something made to suit with Time and place,
A Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,
A talk of college and of ladies' rights,
A feudal knight in silken masquerade,
And, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments
For which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--
This ~were~ a medley! we should have him back
Who told the ""Winter's tale"" to do it for us.
No matter: we will say whatever comes.
And let the ladies sing us, if they will,
From time to time, some ballad or a song
To give us breathing-space.'
So I began,
And the rest followed: and the women sang
Between the rougher voices of the men,
Like linnets in the pauses of the wind:
And here I give the story and the songs.

I

A prince I was, blue-eyed, and fair in face,
Of temper amorous, as the first of May,
With lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl,
For on my cradle shone the Northern star.

There lived an ancient legend in our house.
Some sorcerer, whom a far-off grandsire burnt
Because he cast no shadow, had foretold,
Dying, that none of all our blood should know
The shadow from the substance, and that one
Should come to fight with shadows and to fall.
For so, my mother said, the story ran.
And, truly, waking dreams were, more or less,
An old and strange affection of the house.
Myself too had weird seizures, Heaven knows what:
On a sudden in the midst of men and day,
And while I walked and talked as heretofore,
I seemed to move among a world of ghosts,
And feel myself the shadow of a dream.
Our great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane,
And pawed his beard, and muttered 'catalepsy'.
My mother pitying made a thousand prayers;
My mother was as mild as any saint,
Half-canonized by all that looked on her,
So gracious was her tact and tenderness:
But my good father thought a king a king;
He cared not for the affection of the house;
He held his sceptre like a pedant's wand
To lash offence, and with long arms and hands
Reached out, and picked offenders from the mass
For judgment.
Now it chanced that I had been,
While life was yet in bud and blade, bethrothed
To one, a neighbouring Princess: she to me
Was proxy-wedded with a bootless calf
At eight years old; and still from time to time
Came murmurs of her beauty from the South,
And of her brethren, youths of puissance;
And still I wore her picture by my heart,
And one dark tress; and all around them both
Sweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen.

But when the days drew nigh that I should wed,
My father sent ambassadors with furs
And jewels, gifts, to fetch her: these brought back
A present, a great labour of the loom;
And therewithal an answer vague as wind:
Besides, they saw the king; he took the gifts;
He said there was a compact; that was true:
But then she had a will; was he to blame?
And maiden fancies; loved to live alone
Among her women; certain, would not wed.

That morning in the presence room I stood
With Cyril and with Florian, my two friends:
The first, a gentleman of broken means
(His father's fault) but given to starts and bursts
Of revel; and the last, my other heart,
And almost my half-self, for still we moved
Together, twinned as horse's ear and eye.

Now, while they spake, I saw my father's face
Grow long and troubled like a rising moon,
Inflamed with wrath: he started on his feet,
Tore the king's letter, snowed it down, and rent
The wonder of the loom through warp and woof
From skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware
That he would send a hundred thousand men,
And bring her in a whirlwind: then he chewed
The thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen,
Communing with his captains of the war.

At last I spoke. 'My father, let me go.
It cannot be but some gross error lies
In this report, this answer of a king,
Whom all men rate as kind and hospitable:
Or, maybe, I myself, my bride once seen,
Whate'er my grief to find her less than fame,
May rue the bargain made.' And Florian said:
'I have a sister at the foreign court,
Who moves about the Princess; she, you know,
Who wedded with a nobleman from thence:
He, dying lately, left her, as I hear,
The lady of three castles in that land:
Through her this matter might be sifted clean.'
And Cyril whispered: 'Take me with you too.'
Then laughing 'what, if these weird seizures come
Upon you in those lands, and no one near
To point you out the shadow from the truth!
Take me: I'll serve you better in a strait;
I grate on rusty hinges here:' but 'No!'
Roared the rough king, 'you shall not; we ourself
Will crush her pretty maiden fancies dead
In iron gauntlets: break the council up.'

But when the council broke, I rose and past
Through the wild woods that hung about the town;
Found a still place, and plucked her likeness out;
Laid it on flowers, and watched it lying bathed
In the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees:
What were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?
Proud looked the lips: but while I meditated
A wind arose and rushed upon the South,
And shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks
Of the wild woods together; and a Voice
Went with it, 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win.'

Then, ere the silver sickle of that month
Became her golden shield, I stole from court
With Cyril and with Florian, unperceived,
Cat-footed through the town and half in dread
To hear my father's clamour at our backs
With Ho! from some bay-window shake the night;
But all was quiet: from the bastioned walls
Like threaded spiders, one by one, we dropt,
And flying reached the frontier: then we crost
To a livelier land; and so by tilth and grange,
And vines, and blowing bosks of wilderness,
We gained the mother city thick with towers,
And in the imperial palace found the king.

His name was Gama; cracked and small his voice,
But bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind
On glassy water drove his cheek in lines;
A little dry old man, without a star,
Not like a king: three days he feasted us,
And on the fourth I spake of why we came,
And my bethrothed. 'You do us, Prince,' he said,
Airing a snowy hand and signet gem,
'All honour. We remember love ourselves
In our sweet youth: there did a compact pass
Long summers back, a kind of ceremony--
I think the year in which our olives failed.
I would you had her, Prince, with all my heart,
With my full heart: but there were widows here,
Two widows, Lady Psyche, Lady Blanche;
They fed her theories, in and out of place
Maintaining that with equal husbandry
The woman were an equal to the man.
They harped on this; with this our banquets rang;
Our dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk;
Nothing but this; my very ears were hot
To hear them: knowledge, so my daughter held,
Was all in all: they had but been, she thought,
As children; they must lose the child, assume
The woman: then, Sir, awful odes she wrote,
Too awful, sure, for what they treated of,
But all she is and does is awful; odes
About this losing of the child; and rhymes
And dismal lyrics, prophesying change
Beyond all reason: these the women sang;
And they that know such things--I sought but peace;
No critic I--would call them masterpieces:
They mastered ~me~. At last she begged a boon,
A certain summer-palace which I have
Hard by your father's frontier: I said no,
Yet being an easy man, gave it: and there,
All wild to found an University
For maidens, on the spur she fled; and more
We know not,--only this: they see no men,
Not even her brother Arac, nor the twins
Her brethren, though they love her, look upon her
As on a kind of paragon; and I
(Pardon me saying it) were much loth to breed
Dispute betwixt myself and mine: but since
(And I confess with right) you think me bound
In some sort, I can give you letters to her;
And yet, to speak the truth, I rate your chance
Almost at naked nothing.'
Thus the king;
And I, though nettled that he seemed to slur
With garrulous ease and oily courtesies
Our formal compact, yet, not less (all frets
But chafing me on fire to find my bride)
Went forth again with both my friends. We rode
Many a long league back to the North. At last
From hills, that looked across a land of hope,
We dropt with evening on a rustic town
Set in a gleaming river's crescent-curve,
Close at the boundary of the liberties;
There, entered an old hostel, called mine host
To council, plied him with his richest wines,
And showed the late-writ letters of the king.

He with a long low sibilation, stared
As blank as death in marble; then exclaimed
Averring it was clear against all rules
For any man to go: but as his brain
Began to mellow, 'If the king,' he said,
'Had given us letters, was he bound to speak?
The king would bear him out;' and at the last--
The summer of the vine in all his veins--
'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.
She once had past that way; he heard her speak;
She scared him; life! he never saw the like;
She looked as grand as doomsday and as grave:
And he, he reverenced his liege-lady there;
He always made a point to post with mares;
His daughter and his housemaid were the boys:
The land, he understood, for miles about
Was tilled by women; all the swine were sows,
And all the dogs'--
But while he jested thus,
A thought flashed through me which I clothed in act,
Remembering how we three presented Maid
Or Nymph, or Goddess, at high tide of feast,
In masque or pageant at my father's court.
We sent mine host to purchase female gear;
He brought it, and himself, a sight to shake
The midriff of despair with laughter, holp
To lace us up, till, each, in maiden plumes
We rustled: him we gave a costly bribe
To guerdon silence, mounted our good steeds,
And boldly ventured on the liberties.

We followed up the river as we rode,
And rode till midnight when the college lights
Began to glitter firefly-like in copse
And linden alley: then we past an arch,
Whereon a woman-statue rose with wings
From four winged horses dark against the stars;
And some inscription ran along the front,
But deep in shadow: further on we gained
A little street half garden and half house;
But scarce could hear each other speak for noise
Of clocks and chimes, like silver hammers falling
On silver anvils, and the splash and stir
Of fountains spouted up and showering down
In meshes of the jasmine and the rose:
And all about us pealed the nightingale,
Rapt in her song, and careless of the snare.

There stood a bust of Pallas for a sign,
By two sphere lamps blazoned like Heaven and Earth
With constellation and with continent,
Above an entry: riding in, we called;
A plump-armed Ostleress and a stable wench
Came running at the call, and helped us down.
Then stept a buxom hostess forth, and sailed,
Full-blown, before us into rooms which gave
Upon a pillared porch, the bases lost
In laurel: her we asked of that and this,
And who were tutors. 'Lady Blanche' she said,
'And Lady Psyche.' 'Which was prettiest,
Best-natured?' 'Lady Psyche.' 'Hers are we,'
One voice, we cried; and I sat down and wrote,
In such a hand as when a field of corn
Bows all its ears before the roaring East;

'Three ladies of the Northern empire pray
Your Highness would enroll them with your own,
As Lady Psyche's pupils.'
This I sealed:
The seal was Cupid bent above a scroll,
And o'er his head Uranian Venus hung,
And raised the blinding bandage from his eyes:
I gave the letter to be sent with dawn;
And then to bed, where half in doze I seemed
To float about a glimmering night, and watch
A full sea glazed with muffled moonlight, swell
On some dark shore just seen that it was rich.

As through the land at eve we went,
And plucked the ripened ears,
We fell out, my wife and I,
O we fell out I know not why,
And kissed again with tears.
And blessings on the falling out
That all the more endears,
When we fall out with those we love
And kiss again with tears!
For when we came where lies the child
We lost in other years,
There above the little grave,
O there above the little grave,
We kissed again with tears.

II

At break of day the College Portress came:
She brought us Academic silks, in hue
The lilac, with a silken hood to each,
And zoned with gold; and now when these were on,
And we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,
She, curtseying her obeisance, let us know
The Princess Ida waited: out we paced,
I first, and following through the porch that sang
All round with laurel, issued in a court
Compact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths
Of classic frieze, with ample awnings gay
Betwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.
The Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,
Enringed a billowing fountain in the midst;
And here and there on lattice edges lay
Or book or lute; but hastily we past,
And up a flight of stairs into the hall.

There at a board by tome and paper sat,
With two tame leopards couched beside her throne,
All beauty compassed in a female form,
The Princess; liker to the inhabitant
Of some clear planet close upon the Sun,
Than our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,
And so much grace and power, breathing down
From over her arched brows, with every turn
Lived through her to the tips of her long hands,
And to her feet. She rose her height, and said:

'We give you welcome: not without redound
Of use and glory to yourselves ye come,
The first-fruits of the stranger: aftertime,
And that full voice which circles round the grave,
Will rank you nobly, mingled up with me.
What! are the ladies of your land so tall?'
'We of the court' said Cyril. 'From the court'
She answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:
'The climax of his age! as though there were
One rose in all the world, your Highness that,
He worships your ideal:' she replied:
'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear
This barren verbiage, current among men,
Light coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.
Your flight from out your bookless wilds would seem
As arguing love of knowledge and of power;
Your language proves you still the child. Indeed,
We dream not of him: when we set our hand
To this great work, we purposed with ourself
Never to wed. You likewise will do well,
Ladies, in entering here, to cast and fling
The tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,
Some future time, if so indeed you will,
You may with those self-styled our lords ally
Your fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'

At those high words, we conscious of ourselves,
Perused the matting: then an officer
Rose up, and read the statutes, such as these:
Not for three years to correspond with home;
Not for three years to cross the liberties;
Not for three years to speak with any men;
And many more, which hastily subscribed,
We entered on the boards: and 'Now,' she cried,
'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not. Look, our hall!
Our statues!--not of those that men desire,
Sleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,
Nor stunted squaws of West or East; but she
That taught the Sabine how to rule, and she
The foundress of the Babylonian wall,
The Carian Artemisia strong in war,
The Rhodope, that built the pyramid,
Clelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene
That fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows
Of Agrippina. Dwell with these, and lose
Convention, since to look on noble forms
Makes noble through the sensuous organism
That which is higher. O lift your natures up:
Embrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,
Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:
Drink deep, until the habits of the slave,
The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite
And slander, die. Better not be at all
Than not be noble. Leave us: you may go:
Today the Lady Psyche will harangue
The fresh arrivals of the week before;
For they press in from all the provinces,
And fill the hive.'
She spoke, and bowing waved
Dismissal: back again we crost the court
To Lady Psyche's: as we entered in,
There sat along the forms, like morning doves
That sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,
A patient range of pupils; she herself
Erect behind a desk of satin-wood,
A quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,
And on the hither side, or so she looked,
Of twenty summers. At her left, a child,
In shining draperies, headed like a star,
Her maiden babe, a double April old,
Aglaïa slept. We sat: the Lady glanced:
Then Florian, but not livelier than the dame
That whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,
'My sister.' 'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'
Said Cyril. 'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.

'This world was once a fluid haze of light,
Till toward the centre set the starry tides,
And eddied into suns, that wheeling cast
The planets: then the monster, then the man;
Tattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,
Raw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;
As yet we find in barbarous isles, and here
Among the lowest.'
Thereupon she took
A bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;
Glanced at the legendary Amazon
As emblematic of a nobler age;
Appraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those
That lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;
Ran down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines
Of empire, and the woman's state in each,
How far from just; till warming with her theme
She fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique
And little-footed China, touched on Mahomet
With much contempt, and came to chivalry:
When some respect, however slight, was paid
To woman, superstition all awry:
However then commenced the dawn: a beam
Had slanted forward, falling in a land
Of promise; fruit would follow. Deep, indeed,
Their debt of thanks to her who first had dared
To leap the rotten pales of prejudice,
Disyoke their necks from custom, and assert
None lordlier than themselves but that which made
Woman and man. She had founded; they must build.
Here might they learn whatever men were taught:
Let them not fear: some said their heads were less:
Some men's were small; not they the least of men;
For often fineness compensated size:
Besides the brain was like the hand, and grew
With using; thence the man's, if more was more;
He took advantage of his strength to be
First in the field: some ages had been lost;
But woman ripened earlier, and her life
Was longer; and albeit their glorious names
Were fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth
The highest is the measure of the man,
And not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,
Nor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,
But Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so
With woman: and in arts of government
Elizabeth and others; arts of war
The peasant Joan and others; arts of grace
Sappho and others vied with any man:
And, last not least, she who had left her place,
And bowed her state to them, that they might grow
To use and power on this Oasis, lapt
In the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight
Of ancient influence and scorn.
At last
She rose upon a wind of prophecy
Dilating on the future; 'everywhere
Who heads in council, two beside the hearth,
Two in the tangled business of the world,
Two in the liberal offices of life,
Two plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss
Of science, and the secrets of the mind:
Musician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:
And everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth
Should bear a double growth of those rare souls,
Poets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'

She ended here, and beckoned us: the rest
Parted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she
Began to address us, and was moving on
In gratulation, till as when a boat
Tacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice
Faltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried
'My brother!' 'Well, my sister.' 'O,' she said,
'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?
Why who are these? a wolf within the fold!
A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!
A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'
'No plot, no plot,' he answered. 'Wretched boy,
How saw you not the inscription on the gate,
LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'
'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think
The softer Adams of your Academe,
O sister, Sirens though they be, were such
As chanted on the blanching bones of men?'
'But you will find it otherwise' she said.
'You jest: ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow
Binds me to speak, and O that iron will,
That axelike edge unturnable, our Head,
The Princess.' 'Well then, Psyche, take my life,
And nail me like a weasel on a grange
For warning: bury me beside the gate,
And cut this epitaph above my bones;
~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,
All for the common good of womankind.~'
'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen
And heard the Lady Psyche.'
I struck in:
'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;
Receive it; and in me behold the Prince
Your countryman, affianced years ago
To the Lady Ida: here, for here she was,
And thus (what other way was left) I came.'
'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;
If any, this; but none. Whate'er I was
Disrooted, what I am is grafted here.
Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe
Within this vestal limit, and how should I,
Who am not mine, say, live: the thunderbolt
Hangs silent; but prepare: I speak; it falls.'
'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,
I think no more of deadly lurks therein,
Than in a clapper clapping in a garth,
To scare the fowl from fruit: if more there be,
If more and acted on, what follows? war;
Your own work marred: for this your Academe,
Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo
Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass
With all fair theories only made to gild
A stormless summer.' 'Let the Princess judge
Of that' she said: 'farewell, Sir--and to you.
I shudder at the sequel, but I go.'

'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,
'The fifth in line from that old Florian,
Yet hangs his portrait in my father's hall
(The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow
Sun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)
As he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,
And all else fled? we point to it, and we say,
The loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,
But branches current yet in kindred veins.'
'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she
With whom I sang about the morning hills,
Flung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,
And snared the squirrel of the glen? are you
That Psyche, won't to bind my throbbing brow,
To smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught
Of fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read
My sickness down to happy dreams? are you
That brother-sister Psyche, both in one?
You were that Psyche, but what are you now?'
'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom
I would be that for ever which I seem,
Woman, if I might sit beside your feet,
And glean your scattered sapience.'
Then once more,
'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,
'That on her bridal morn before she past
From all her old companions, when the kind
Kissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties
Would still be dear beyond the southern hills;
That were there any of our people there
In want or peril, there was one to hear
And help them? look! for such are these and I.'
'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,
In gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn
Came flying while you sat beside the well?
The creature laid his muzzle on your lap,
And sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood
Was sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.
That was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.
O by the bright head of my little niece,
You were that Psyche, and what are you now?'
'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,
'The mother of the sweetest little maid,
That ever crowed for kisses.'

Miami heat, palm trees in the breeze
You're the the sweetest thing, the sweetest thing I've ever seen
Sand at my feet, ocean after that
Silver light of the moon dancing on the waves
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Girl, you got me high, just with your eyes
Every word you say, well, it's a lullaby
Pull me inside out
Put me upside down
Silence all of the noise that I can do without
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You're the sweetest thing
That I ever did see
Like a bird taking wing
Tears that set you free
You're the sweetest thing

I know you're troubled about
Changes that are weighing you down
When life just ain't fair, it's okay to be scared
Nobody's that figured out
And I know a place we can hide
Paint our own world full of life
Ride off in the sunset, get lost in the moment
Even if it's just tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, sink in this bed, stare with me at the ceiling
Let's lay here, catching our breath
And if we slip away while we're high on the feeling
I promise we won't have regrets
If you just let me love you to death

[Verse 2]
Just 'cause I ain't one for crowds
Don't mean you don't make me proud
And I'm a hard pill to take and I'm the first one to say
I ain't got it all figured out

[Chorus]
Baby, sink in this bed, stare with me at the ceiling
Let's lay here, catching our breath
And if we slip away while we're high on the feeling
I promise we won't have regrets

I was just a wandering soul
Working through the highs and lows
I heard a spirit whisper slow
Drift into a great unknown
Will anybody see my ghost?

So let me off at the end of the night
Because all my friends are giving up
And I've had enough
Ooooo oo oo

I began to hear my name
And silence in a hurricane
The dust was leaving from my veins
Like some forgotten border train
Carried to my home again

Let the bough break, let it come down crashin'
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
I can't say I'd even notice it was absent
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
I'll unfold before you
Would have strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter

[Chorus]
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true
Just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again
My whole heart
Will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

We are not perfect
We'll learn from our mistakes
And as long as it takes
I will prove my love to you

Do you remember?
When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel
So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always bе there right by your side
'Causе baby, you're always in my mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 2]
I never knew it would be possible
For you to be with me
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73
I was so jealous seeing you with him
Oh, baby, I know that I can treat you better back in those nights
Oh, you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh, baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine

Waiting for you, babe
Saw you in your gown

I hear the beat and start crying
It's quarter past 4 I'm on the corner still trying
I quarterback it all, just trying to make my quota
A stranger on this corner so I barely make a quarter back
I'm at the condo with Cardo
Apartment in Parkdale that's where I do my recording
Meetings with Solo, that's my shooter up in Sotto & Sotto
In the 6 but it ain't OVO though
Money Team ain't no squares in my oval
I shine around the world bitch I'm global*
At the shows meeting fans taking photos
Barely making rent off the show dough
Back when I would smoke with Lim he'd teach me how to cope with things
He told me cut the grass and don't you let the cobras in
He could have been Kobe with a little coaching
But on my culture that's my nigga we'll be close again
My auntie walking with a cane
I'm walking through the rain
I've barely got a dollar to my name
Every dollar I would gain, would be the same dollar I'd deposit to the game
I charge it to the game
Baby mama stressing
I'm counting down the days, she told me count my blessings
I'd rather count the paper, mama call the reverend
Like I need Jesus, there's things that need addressing
Like why I ain't got no deal
My baby brother off the pill, I want to fight him that's my blood for real
I guess he likes the thrill
My bigger brother kind of liked it too
He in the bin now and I ain't even writing to him
I got my own problems
I got my daughter in December
It's edging on November
Can't even make the rent out my apartment in September
Been broke since like forever
So if ya' nigga ever hit a lick I can't remember
What the feeling is like
I wonder what a million is like
All my niggas in the building tonight
Ready to make a killing tonight
I could chill or peel a cap, nigga that's life
I could seal a pack, deliver that, and deal with the strife
Or I could stomach that and cry into my pillow tonight
I punk niggas, black punk nigga for life
What's up with niggas?
The cost of living,  I know they livid
Sean Leon, the Corleone, my core frigid

On point with every sentence, like I'm fencing
On guard, so it's offensive when you say I'm next then
Like I ain't Wayne Gretzky meets Bruce Wayne meets Hussein
I got that bomb, I'm 2 Chainz meets Wu-Tang
I'm Pootie-tang when the pistols pop, her pussy came
If you're dissing, don't be sneaking, say my name
I'm from the era of shitty virals and cheapened fame
I fall in love with a moment I'll never need again
I hope I see it with my friends before I see the end
Until we meet again
It's over5Embed"

I heard the name Josephine
It came to me in a dream
And I don't usually set too much store by the things these things might mean
But it was spoken with seriousness
More of a whisper than a scream
So now I'm waiting on some Josephine
To show herself to me

[Chorus]
I could have been anyone I imagined I could be
I just needed somebody to wake me from my sleep
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come now, Josephine, show yourself to me

[Verse 2]
So come on now, Josephine, give me what I need
I don't like to be needy but needs must
I can't stand being the person that I've been
I'm an impending car crash
And you're the first one on the scene
I'm a defeated commander
I'm a half-deaf composer
I'm a strange name whispered in a dream

So come on now, Josephine
Let's pretend it's Halloween
You come as a car crash
I'll go as James Dean
I'm Napoloeon on Elba
And you're a hundred days in 1815
I wrote all of these letters to my immortal beloved
And you're the only one who's ever going to know what they mean

[Outro]
Come on now, Josephine
Wake me from my sleep
I could have been anyone
But I ended up being me
I could have been wide awake
Could have been what you need
I wish that I was anyone except for just me
So come on now, Josephine
Show yourself to me

Our life wasn't always quite like this
Used to kick back and relax, yeah, it was pure bliss
Then suddenly, things changed
And our life was rearranged
Every moment goes by so fast

[Verse 2]
My days would always start with you
We would wake up, hold hands with nothing to lose
The seconds lingered on as we played our favorite songs
Now every moment goes by so fast
Mmm

[Chorus]
Can we slow down time?
Just you and I
Lights are flashing, people move
But when I look into your eyes
We can slow down time

[Post-Chorus]

Will you still love me the same?
Let's freeze the moment before it's passed

You'll be the fool this time

For a little while

You'll give me a chance
You'll let me break you down
Let me use you up
You'll show me how

Oh, my love

They must be getting tired
Trying to keep your feet
Up off the ground

Let's go back
To the days beneath the Northern Lights
When we danced so free

THOUGH her next move should have been to contact Randolph Driblette again, she decided instead to drive up to Berkeley. She wanted to find out where Richard Wharfinger had got his information about Trystero. Possibly also take a look at how the inventor John Nefastis picked up his mail.

As with Mucho when she'd left Kinneret, Metzger did not seem desperate at her going. She debated, driving north, whether to stop off at home on the way to Berkeley or coming back. As it turned out she missed the exit for Kinneret and that solved it. She purred along up the east side of the bay, presently climbed into the Berkeley hills and arrived close to midnight at a sprawling, many-leveled, German-baroque hotel, carpeted in deep green, going in for curved corridors and ornamental chandeliers. A sign in the lobby said WELCOME CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AMERICAN DEAF-MUTE ASSEMBLY. Every light in the place burned, alarmingly bright; a truly ponderable silence occupied the building. A clerk popped up from behind the desk where he'd been sleeping and began making sign language at her. Oedipa considered giving him the finger to see what would happen. But she'd driven straight through, and all at once the fatigue of it had caught up with her. The clerk took her to a room with a reproduction of a Remedios Varo in it, through corridors gently curving as the streets of San Francisco, utterly silent. She fell asleep almost at once, but kept waking from a nightmare about something in the mirror, across from her bed.

Nothing specific, only a possibility, nothing she could see. When she finally did settle into sleep, she dreamed that Mucho, her husband, was making love to her on a soft white beach that was not part of any California she knew. When she woke in the morning, she was sitting bolt upright, staring into the mirror at her own exhausted face. She found the Lectern Press in a small office building on Shattuck Avenue. They didn't have Plays of Ford, Webster, Tourneur and Wharfinger on the premises, but did take her check for $12.50, gave her the address of their warehouse in Oakland and a receipt to show the people there. By the time she'd collected the book, it was afternoon. She skimmed through to find the line that had brought her all the way up here. And in the leaf-fractured sunlight, froze.

No hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, ran the couplet, Who once has crossed the lusts of Angela. ""No,"" she protested aloud. "" 'Who's once been set his tryst with Trystero.'"" The pencilled note in the paperback had mentioned a variant. But the paperback was supposed to be a straight reprint of the book she now held. Puzzled, she saw that this edition also had a footnote: According only to the Quarto edition (1687). The earlier Folio has a lead inserted where the closing line should have been. D'Amico has suggested that Wharfinger may have made a libellous comparison involving someone at court, and that the later 'restoration' was actually the work of the printer, Inigo Barfstable. The doubtful 'Whitechapel' version (c. 1670) has This tryst or odious awry, O Niccolo,' which besides bringing in a quite graceless Alexandrine, is difficult to make sense of syntactically, unless we accept the rather unorthodox though persuasive argument of J.-K. Sale that the line is really a pun on 'This trystero dies irae . . . .' This, however, it must be pointed out, leaves the line nearly as corrupt as before, owing to no clear meaning for the word trystero, unless it be a pseudo-Italianate variant on triste (= wretched, depraved). But the 'White-chapel' edition, besides being a fragment, abounds in such corrupt and probably spurious lines, as we have mentioned elsewhere, and is hardly to be trusted.

Then where, Oedipa wondered, does the paperback I bought at Zapf's get off with its ""Trystero"" line? Was there yet another edition, besides the Quarto, Folio, and ""Whitechapel"" fragment? The editor's preface, signed this time, by one Emory Bortz, professor of English at Cal, mentioned none. She spent nearly an hour more, searching through all the footnotes, finding nothing.
""Dammit,"" she yelled, started the car and headed for the Berkeley campus, to find Professor Bortz. She should have remembered the date on the book 1957. Another world. The girl in the English office informed Oedipa that Professor Bortz was no longer with the faculty. He was teaching at San Francisco College, San Francisco, California.

Of course, Odeipa thought, wry, where else? She copied the address and walked away trying to remember who'd put out the paperback. She couldn't. It was summer, a weekday, and midafternoon; no time for any campus Oedipa knew of to be jumping, yet this one was. She came downslope from Wheeler Hall, through Sather Gate into a plaza teeming with corduroy, denim, bare legs, blonde hair, horn rims, bicycle spokes in the sun, book bags, swaying card tables, long paper petitions dangling to earth, posters for undecipherable FSM's, YAF's, VDC's, suds in the fountain, students in nose-to-nose dialogue. She moved through it carrying her fat book, attracted, unsure, a stranger, wanting to feel relevant but knowing how much of a search among alternate universes it would take. For she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves, blandness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them, this having been a national reflex to certain pathologies in high places only death had had the power to cure, and this Berkeley was like no somnolent Siwash out of her own past at all, but more akin to those Far Eastern or Latin American universities you read about, those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folklores may be brought into doubt, cataclysmic of dissents voiced, suicidal of commitments chosen the sort that bring governments down.

But it was English she was hearing as she crossed Bancroft Way among the blonde children and the muttering Hondas and Su-zukis; American English. Where were Secretaries James and Foster and Senator Joseph, those dear daft numina who'd mothered over Oedipa's so temperate youth? In another world. Along another pattern of track, another string of decisions taken, switches closed, the faceless points men who'd thrown them now all transferred, deserted, in stir, fleeing the skip-tracers, out of their skull, on horse, alcoholic, fanatic, under aliases, dead, impossible to find ever again. Among them they had managed to turn the young Oedipa into a rare creature indeed, unfit perhaps for marches and sit-ins, but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in Jacobean texts.
She pulled the Impala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of Telegraph Avenue and found in a phone book the address of John Nefastis. She then drove to a pseudo-Mexican apartment house, looked for his name among the U. S. mailboxes, ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door. He had a crew-cut and the same underage look as Koteks, but wore a shirt on various Polynesian themes and dating from the Truman administration.

Introducing herself, she invoked the name of Stanley Koteks. ""He said you could tell me whether or not I'm a 'sensitive'.""Nefastis had been watching on his TV set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a Watusi. ""I like to watch young stuff,"" he explained. ""There's something about a little chick that age.""
""So does my husband,"" she said. ""I understand.""John Nefastis beamed at her, simpatico, and brought out his Machine from a workroom in back. It looked about the way the patent had described it. ""You know how this works?"" ""Stanley gave me a kind of rundown."" He began then, bewilderingly, to talk about something called entropy. The word bothered him as much as ""Trystero"" bothered Oedipa. But it was too technical for her. She did gather that there were two distinct kinds of this entropy. One having to do with heat-engines, the other to do with communication. The equation for one, back in the '3o's, had looked very like the equation for the other. It was a coincidence. The two fields were entirely unconnected, except at one point: Maxwell's Demon. As the Demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold, the system was said to lose entropy. But somehow the loss was offset by the information the Demon gained about what molecules were where.

""Communication is the key,"" cried Nefastis. ""The Demon passes his data on to the sensitive, and the sensitive must reply in kind. There are untold billions of molecules in that box. The Demon collects data on each and every one. At some deep psychic level he must get through. The sensitive must receive that staggering set of energies, and feedback something like the same quantity of information. To keep it all cycling. On the secular level all we can see is one piston, hopefully moving. One little movement, against all that massive complex of information, destroyed over and over with each power stroke.""
""Help,"" said Oedipa, ""you're not reaching me.""

""Entropy is a figure of speech, then,"" sighed Nefastis, ""a metaphor. It connects the world of thermo-dynamics to the world of information flow. The Machine uses both. The Demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful, but also objectively true.""
""But what,"" she felt like some kind of a heretic, ""if the Demon exists only because the two equations look alike? Because of the metaphor?""
Nefastis smiled; impenetrable, calm, a believer. ""He existed for Clerk Maxwell long before the days of the metaphor.""

But had Clerk Maxwell been such a fanatic about his Demon's reality? She looked at the picture on the outside of the box. Clerk Maxwell was in profile and would not meet her eyes. The forehead was round and smooth, and there was a curious bump at the back of his head, covered by curling hair. His visible eye seemed mild and noncommittal, but Oedipa wondered what hangups, crises, spookings in the middle of the night might be developed from the shadowed subtleties of his mouth, hidden under a full beard.

""Watch the picture,"" said Nefastis, ""and concentrate on a cylinder. Don't worry. If you're a sensitive you'll know which one. Leave your mind open, receptive to the Demon's message. I'll be back."" He returned to his TV set, which was now showing cartoons. Oedipa sat through two Yogi Bears, one Magilla Gorilla and a Peter Potamus, staring at Clerk Maxwell's enigmatic profile, waiting for the Demon to communicate.

Are you there, little fellow, Oedipa asked the Demon, or is Nefastis putting me on. Unless a piston moved, she'd never know. Clerk Maxwell's hands were cropped out of the photograph. He might have been holding a book. He gazed away, into some vista of Victorian England whose light had been lost forever. Oedipa's anxiety grew. It seemed, behind the beard, he'd begun, ever so faintly, to smile. Something in his eyes, certainly, had changed.

And there. At the top edge of what she could see: hadn't the right-hand piston moved, a fraction? She couldn't look directly, the instructions were to keep her eyes on Clerk Maxwell. Minutes passed, pistons remained frozen in place. High-pitched, comic voices issued from the TV set. She had seen only a retinal twitch, a misfired nerve cell. Did the true sensitive see more? In her colon now she was afraid, growing more so, that nothing would happen. Why worry, she worried; Nefastis is a nut, forget it, a sincere nut. The true sensitive is the one that can share in the man's hallucinations, that's all.

How wonderful they might be to share. For fifteen minutes more she tried; repeating, if you are there, whatever you are, show yourself to me, I need you, show yourself. But nothing happened.

""I'm sorry,"" she called in, surprisingly about to cry with frustration, her voice breaking, ""It's no use."" Nefastis came to her and put an arm around her shoulders. ""It's OK,"" he said. ""Please don't cry. Come on in on the couch. The news will be on any minute. We can do it there.""""It?"" said Oedipa. ""Do it? What?""""Have sexual intercourse,"" replied Nefastis. ""Maybe there'll be something about China tonight. I like to do it while they talk about Viet Nam, but China is best of all. You think about all those Chinese. Teeming. That profusion of life. It makes it sexier, right?""""Gah,"" Oedipa screamed, and fled, Nefastis snapping his fingers through the dark rooms behind her in a hippy-dippy, oh-go-ahead-then-chick fashion he had doubtless learned from watching the TV also.
""Say hello to old Stanley,"" he called as she pattered down the steps into the street, flung a babushka over her license plate and screeched away down Telegraph. She drove more or less automatically until a swift boy in a Mustang, perhaps unable to contain the new sense of virility his auto gave him, nearly killed her and she realized that she was on the freeway, heading irreversibly for the Bay Bridge. It was the middle of rush hour. Oedipa was appalled at the spectacle, having thought such traffic only possible in Los Angeles, places like that. Looking down at San Francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridge's arc, she saw smog.

Haze, she corrected herself, is what it is, haze. How can they have smog in San Francisco? Smog, according to the folklore, did not begin till farther south. It had to be the angle of the sun. Amid the exhaust, sweat, glare and ill-humor of a summer evening on an American freeway, Oedipa Maas pondered her Trystero problem. All the silence of San Francisco,the calm surface of the motel pool, the contemplative contours of residential streets like rakings in the sand of a Japanese garden had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness. For John Nefastis (to take a recent example) two kinds of entropy, thermodynamic and informational, happened, say by coincidence, to look alike, when you wrote them down as equations. Yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable, with the help of Maxwell's Demon. Now here was Oedipa, faced with a metaphor of God knew how many parts; more than two, anyway.

With coincidences blossoming these days wherever she looked, she had nothing but a sound, a word, Trystero, a to hold them together. She knew a few things about it: it had opposed the Thurn and Taxis postal system in Europe; its symbol was a muted post horn; sometime before 1853 it had appeared in America and fought the Pony Express and Wells, Fargo, either as outlaws in black, or disguised as Indians; and it survived today, in California, serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual persuasion, inventors who believed in the reality of Maxwell's Demon, possibly her own husband, Mucho Maas (but she'd thrown Mucho's letter long away, there was no way for Genghis Cohen to check the stamp, so if she wanted to find out for sure she'd have to ask Mucho himself).

Either Trystero did exist, in its own right, or it was being presumed, perhaps fantasied by Oedipa, so hung up on and interpenetrated with the dead man's estate. Here in San Francisco, away from all tangible assets of that estate, there might still be a chance of getting the whole thing to go away and disintegrate quietly. She had only to drift tonight, at random, and watch nothing happen, to be convinced it was purely nervous, a little something for her shrink to fix. She got off the freeway at North Beach, drove around, parked finally in a steep side-street among warehouses. Then walked along Broadway, into the first crowds of evening.

But it took her no more than an hour to catch sight of a muted post horn. She was moseying along a street full of aging boys in Roos Atkins suits when she collided with a gang of guided tourists come rowdy-dowing out of a Volkswagen bus, on route to take in a few San Francisco nite spots. ""Let me lay this on you,"" a voice spoke into her ear, ""because I just left,"" and she found being deftly pinned outboard of one breast this big cerise ID badge, reading Hi! MY NAME Is Arnold Snarb! AND I'M LOOKIN' FOR A GOOD TIME! Oedipa glanced around and saw a cherubic face vanishing with a wink in among natural shoulders and striped shirts, and away went Arnold Snarb, looking for a better time.
Somebody blew on an athletic whistle and Oedipa found herself being herded, along with other badged citizens, toward a bar called The Greek Way. Oh, no, Oedipa thought, not a fag joint, no; and for a minute tried to fight out of the human surge, before recalling how she had decided to drift tonight.
""Now in here,"" their guide, sweating dark tentacles into his tab collar, briefed them, ""you are going to see the members of the third sex, the lavender crowd this city by the Bay is so justly famous for. To some of you the experience may seem a little queer, but remember, try not to act like a bunch of tourists. If you get propositioned it'll all be in fun, just part of the gay night life to be found here in famous North Beach. Two drinks and when you hear the whistle it means out, on the double, regroup right here. If you're well behaved we'll hit Finocchio's next.""
He blew the whistle twice and the tourists, breaking into a yell, swept Oedipa inside, in a frenzied assault on the bar. When things had calmed she was near the door with an unidentifiable drink in her fist, jammed against somebody tall in a suede sport coat. In the lapel of which she spied, wrought exquisitely in some pale, glimmering alloy, not another cerise badge, but a pin in the shape of the Trystero post horn. Mute and everything.

All right, she told herself. You lose. A game try, all one hour's worth. She should have left then and gone back to Berkeley, to the hotel. But couldn't.
""What if I told you,"" she addressed the owner of the pin, ""that I was an agent of Thurn and Taxis?""

""What,"" he answered, ""some theatrical agency?"" He had large ears, hair cropped nearly to his scalp, acne on his face, and curiously empty eyes, which now swiveled briefly to Oedipa's breasts. ""How'd you get a name like Arnold Snarb?""
""If you tell me where you got your lapel pin,"" said Oedipa.""Sorry.""

She sought to bug him: ""If it's a homosexual sign or something, that doesn't bother me.""Eyes showing nothing: ""I don't swing that way,"" he said. ""Yours either."" Turned his back on her and ordered a drink. Oedipa took off her badge, put it in an ashtray and said, quietly, trying not to suggest hysteria, ""Look, you have to help me. Because I really think I am going out of my head.""
""You have the wrong outfit, Arnold. Talk to your clergyman.""

""I use the U. S. Mail because I was never taught any different,"" she pleaded. ""But I'm not your enemy. I don't want to be."" ""What about my friend?"" He came spinning around on the stool to face her again. ""You want to be that, Arnold?"" ""I don't know,"" she thought she'd better say. He looked at her, blank. ""What do you know?"" She told him everything. Why not? Held nothing back. At the end of it the tourists had been whistled away and he'd bought two rounds to Oedipa's three. ""I'd heard about 'Kirby,'"" he said, ""it's a code name, nobody real. But none of the rest, your Sinophile across the bay, or that sick play. I never thought there was a history to it.""""I think of nothing but,"" she said, and a little plaintive.""And,"" scratching the stubble on his head, ""you have nobody else to tell this to. Only somebody in a bar whose name you don't know?""
She wouldn't look at him. ""I guess not."" ""No husband, no shrink?"" ""Both,"" Oedipa said, ""but they don't know.""""You can't tell them?"" She met his eyes' void for a second after all, and shrugged. ""I'll tell you what I know, then,"" he decided. ""The pin I'm wearing means I'm a member of the IA. That's Inamorati Anonymous. An inamorato is somebody in love. That's the worst addiction of all.""

""Somebody is about to fall in love,"" Oedipa said, ""you go sit with them, or something?"" ""Right. The whole idea is to get to where you don't need it. I was lucky. I kicked it young. But there aresixty-year-old men, believe it or not, and women even older, who wake up in the night screaming."" ""You hold meetings, then, like the AA?"" ""No, of course not. You get a phone number, an answering service you can call. Nobody knows anybody else's name; just the number in case it gets so bad you can't handle it alone. We're isolates, Arnold. Meetings would destroy the whole point of it."" ""What about the person who comes to sit with you? Suppose you fall in love with them?""

""They go away,"" he said. ""You never see them twice. The answering service dispatches them, and they're careful not to have any repeats.""How did the post horn come in? That went back to their founding. In the early '6o's a Yoyodyne executive living near L.A. and located someplace in the corporate root-system above supervisor but below vice-president, found himself, at age 39, automated out of a job. Having been since age 7 rigidly instructed in an eschatology that pointed nowhere but to a presidency and death, trained to do absolutely nothing but sign his name to specialized memoranda he could not begin to understand and to take blame for the running-amok of specialized programs that failed for specialized reasons he had to have explained to him, the executive's first thoughts were naturally of suicide. But previous training got the better of him: he could not make the decision without first hearing the ideas of a committee. He placed an ad in the personal column of the L.A.

Times, asking whether anyone who'd been in the same fix had ever found any good reasons for not committing suicide. His shrewd assumption being that no suicides would reply, leaving him automatically with only valid inputs. The assumption was false. After a week of anxiously watching the mailbox through little Japanese binoculars his wife had given him for a going-away present (she'd left him the day after he was pink-slipped) and getting nothing but sucker-list stuff through the regular deliveries that came each noon, he was jolted out of a boozy, black-and-white dream of jumping off The Stack into rush-hour traffic, by an insistent banging at the door. It was late on a Sunday afternoon. He opened his door and found an aged bum with a knitted watch cap on his head and a hook for a hand, who presented him with a bundle of letters and loped away without a word. Most of the letters were from suicides who had failed, either through clumsiness or last-minute cowardice. None of them, however, could offer any compelling reasons for staying alive.

Still the executive dithered: spent another week with pieces of paper on which he would list, in columns headed ""pro"" and ""con,"" reasons for and against taking his Brody. He found it impossible, in the absence of some trigger, to come to any clear decision. Finally one day he noticed a front page story in the Times, complete with AP wire photo, about a Buddhist monk in Viet Nam who had set himself on fire to protest government policies. ""Groovy!"" cried the executive. He went to the garage, siphoned all the gasoline from his Buick's tank, put on his green Zachary All suit with the vest, stuffed all his letters from unsuccessful suicides into a coat pocket, went in the kitchen, sat on the floor, proceeded to douse himself good with the gasoline. He was about to make the farewell flick of the wheel on his faithful Zippo, which had seen him through the Norman hedgerows, the Ardennes, Germany, and postwar America, when he heard a key in the front door, and voices. It was his wife and some man, whom he soon recognized as the very efficiency expert at Yoyodyne who had caused him to be replaced by an IBM 7094.

Intrigued by the irony of it, he sat in the kitchen and listened, leaving his necktie dipped in the gasoline as a sort of wick. From what he could gather, the efficiency expert wished to have sexual intercourse with the wife on the Moroccan rug in the living room. The wife was not unwilling. The executive heard lewd laughter, zippers, the thump of shoes, heavy breathing, moans. He took his tie out of the gasoline and started to snigger. He closed the top on his Zippo. ""I hear laughing,"" his wife said presently. ""I smell gasoline,"" said the efficiency expert. Hand in hand, naked, the two proceeded to the kitchen. ""I was about to do the Buddhist monk thing,"" explained the executive. ""Nearly three weeks it takes him,"" marvelled the efficiency expert, ""to decide. You know how long it would've taken the IBM 7094? Twelve microseconds. No wonder you were replaced."" The executive threw back his head and laughed for a solid ten minutes, along toward the middle of which his wife and her friend, alarmed, retired, got dressed and went out looking for the police.

The executive undressed, showered and hung his suit out on the line to dry. Then he noticed a curious thing. The stamps on some of the letters in his suit pocket had turned almost white. He realized that the gasoline must have dissolved the printing ink. Idly, he peeled off a stamp and saw suddenly the image of the muted post horn, the skin of his hand showing clearly through the watermark. ""A sign,"" he whispered, ""is what it is."" If he'd been a religious man he would have fallen to his knees. As it was, he only declared, with great solemnity: ""My big mistake was love. From this day I swear to stay off of love: hetero, homo, bi, dog or cat, car, every kind there is. I will found a society of isolates, dedicated to this purpose, and this sign, revealed by the same gasoline that almost destroyed me, will be its emblem."" And he did.Oedipa, by now rather drunk, said, ""Where is he now?""
""He's anonymous,"" said the anonymous inamorato. ""Why not write to him through your WASTE system? Say 'Founder, IA.'"" ""But I don't know how to use it,"" she said. ""Think of it,"" he went on, also drunk. ""A whole underworld of suicides who failed. All keeping in touch through that secret delivery system. What do they tell each other?"" He shook his head, smiling, stumbled off his stool and headed off to take a leak, disappearing into the dense crowd. He didn't come back.

Oedipa sat, feeling as alone as she ever had, now the only woman, she saw, in a room full of drunken male homosexuals. Story of my life, she thought, Mucho won't talk to me, Hilarius won't listen, Clerk Maxwell didn't even look at me, and this group, God knows. Despair came over her, as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you. She gauged the spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate (an Indian-looking kid hardly out of his teens, with frosted shoulder-length hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots) to dry speculation (a horn-rimmed SS type who stared at her legs, trying to figure out if she was in drag), none of which could do her any good. So she got up after a while and left The Greek Way, and entered the city again, the infected city.

And spent the rest of the night finding the image of the Trystero post horn. In Chinatown, in the dark window of a herbalist, she thought she saw it on a sign among ideographs. But the streetlight was dim. Later, on a sidewalk, she saw two of them in chalk, 20 feet apart. Between them a complicated array of boxes, some with letters, some with numbers. A kids' game? Places on a. map, dates from a secret history? She copied the diagram in her memo book. When she looked up, a man, perhaps a man, in a black suit, was standing in a doorway half a block away, watching her. She thought she saw a turned-around collar but took no chances; headed back the way she'd come, pulse thundering. A bus stopped at the next corner, and she ran to catch it.

She stayed with buses after that, getting off only now and then to walk so she'd keep awake. What fragments of dreams came had to do with the post horn. Later, possibly, she would have trouble sorting the night into real and dreamed.At some indefinite passage in night's sonorous score, it also came to her that she would be safe, that something, perhaps only her linearly fading drunkenness, would protect her. The city was hers, as, made up and sleeked so with the customary words and images (cosmopolitan, culture, cable cars) it had not been before: she had safe-passage tonight to its far blood's branching’s, be they capillaries too small for more than peering into, or vessels mashed together in shameless municipal hickeys, out on the skin for all but tourists to see. Nothing of the nights could touch her; nothing did. The repetition of symbols was to be enough, without trauma as well perhaps to attenuate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory.

She was meant to remember. She faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony, roller-coaster ride, feeding-time among the beasts in a zoo any death-wish that can be consummated by some minimum gesture. She touched the edge of its voluptuous field, knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it; that not gravity's pull, laws of ballistics, feral ravening, promised more delight. She tested it, shivering: I am meant to remember. Each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity, its fine chances for permanence. But then she wondered if the gem-like ""clues"" were only some kind of compensation. To make up for her having lost the direct, epileptic Word, the cry that might abolish the night.

In Golden Gate Park she came on a circle of children in their nightclothes, who told her they were dreaming the gathering. But that the dream was really no different from being awake, because in the mornings when they got up they felt tired, as if they'd been up most of the night. When their mothers thought they were out playing they were really curled in cupboards of neighbors' houses, in platforms up in trees, in secretly-hollowed nests inside hedges, sleeping, making up for these hours. The night was empty of all terror for them, they had inside their circle an imaginary fire, and needed nothing but their own unpenetrated sense of community. They knew about the post horn, but nothing of the chalked game Oedipa had seen on the sidewalk. You used only one image and it was a jump-rope game, a little girl explained: you stepped alternately in the loop, the bell, and the mute, while your girlfriend sang:

Tristoe, Tristoe, one, two, three, Turning taxi from across the sea ... ""Thurn and Taxis, you mean?"" They'd never heard it that way. Went on warming their hands at an invisible fire. Oedipa, to retaliate, stopped believing in them.
In an all-night Mexican greasy spoon off 24th, she found a piece of her past, in the form of one Jesus Arrabal, who was sitting in a corner under the TV set, idly stirring his bowl of opaque soup with the foot of a chicken. ""Hey,"" he greeted Oedipa, ""you were the lady in Mazatlan."" He beckoned her to sit.
""You remember everything,"" Oedipa said, ""Jesus; even tourists. How is your CIA?"" Standing not for the agency you think, but for a clandestine Mexican outfit known as the Conjuration de los Insurgentes Anarquis-tas, traceable back to the time of the Flores Mag6n brothers and later briefly allied with Zapata.
""You see. In exile,"" waving his arm around at the place. He was part-owner here with a yucateco who still believed in the Revolution. Their Revolution. ""And you. Are you still with that gringo who spent too much money on you? The oligarchist, the miracle?"" ""He died.""

""Ah, pobrecito."" They had met Jesus Arrabal on the beach, where he had previously announced an anti-government rally. Nobody had showed up. So he fell to talking to Inverarity, the enemy he must, to be true to his faith, learn. Pierce, because of his neutral manners when in the presence of ill-will, had nothing to tell Arrabal; he played the rich, obnoxious gringo so perfectly that Oedipa had seen gooseflesh come up along the anarchist's forearms, due to no Pacific sea-breeze. Soon as Pierce went off to sport in the surf, Arrabal asked her if he was real, or a spy, or making fun of him. Oedipa didn't understand.
""You know what a miracle is. Not what Bakunin said. But another world's intrusion into this one. Most of the time we coexist peacefully, but when we do touch there's cataclysm. Like the church we hate, anarchists also believe in another world. Where revolutions break out spontaneous and leaderless, and the soul's talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort, automatic as the body itself. And yet, sena, if any of it should ever really happen that perfectly, I would also have to cry miracle. An anarchist miracle. Like your friend. He is too exactly and without flaw the thing we fight. In Mexico the privilegiado is always, to a finite percentage, redeemed one of the people. Unmiraculous. But your friend, unless he"

It comes in the night, it comes in the day
No matter where I go, I'll never get away!
Slipping rats around my neck
Slowly squeezing the life from my chest!
Gasping for breath, gasping for air
Needing to run, but not knowing where
The scent of the sweat, it fills the room
I think that I am being consumed by the fear!
Being consumed by the fear!

[Verse 2]
The heat is rising, I can't get away
For the live that I lived there will be hell to pay!
Here comes the terror, filling my being
My vision blurs, why can't I see?!
Something withering, flailing inside
It needs to get out, I need to die!
I need to escape, get out of this tomb
Why am I always being consumed by the fear?!
Being consumed by the fear!

[Outro]
It's eating me up!
Never enough!
It's here for death!

Let’s burn, let’s turn rubble from a love to light
Keep warm in the storm
Breathe awake a little fire
Only for the lonely nights

[Verse 2]
Rip a line from the page
Watch it fade up in smoke
Hope rise through the rain, higher than we’d ever go
Blown away, it’s gone cold you say

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s someone else’s spark
In someone else’s heart
As someone else falls in love with you

[Chorus]
And all that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get
Is sparks

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh, just sparks
Oh oh, these sparks
Oh oh, lost sparks
Oh oh

Come on, rest, take a breath
Feel your chest fall and rise
Lay by my side, watch the morning fight over you
Against the glow we knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s someone else’s spark
In someone else’s heart
As someone else falls in love with you

[Chorus]
And all that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get now
Is sparks
And all we kept from the ember’s deep red
Are the memories we let fly
Like sparks

[Bridge]
Leave me the pieces
I'll tape this back together
Don’t try to say goodbye
I’ll be fine, go on now, find another

[Chorus]
All that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get now
Is sparks
And all we kept from the ember’s deep red
Are the memories we let fly
Like sparks
