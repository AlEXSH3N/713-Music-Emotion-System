About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

""Son"", his daddy told him, ""Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew""

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first
You might also likeRoaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him firstEmbed",2,1,1

Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?
King for the day and he loves the road
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold

That's Frosty the Snowman
He's a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
So, down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

For Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Damn I hate this job
To work in this dump you gotta be a snob
Everybody gets on my nerves in this place
I think I'll take the afternoon off from the rat race
An exciting career
Don't amount to much but a pain in the rear
I bust my ass all day for a dollar
And then I go home and listen to the kids holler
Devoted spouse waitin' in the den
Wants to hit me upside the head with a rolling pin
Does that ring a bell?
A daily routine we all know well
I'm makin' more but enjoyin' it less
The good life's mainly causin' me stress
Making a change is difficult but
I gotta try to get out of this rut
But fear seems to be holdin' me back
Courage is the principle trait I lack
I gotta calm my nerves so I can think
I pour myself a nice stiff drink
And another this is my usual mode
One for the money and ten for the road
Ah, now everything is clear
I gotta get the hell out of here
Yes now my mission is plain
A Big Mac is calling my name
I gotta sample some of Ronald's cooking
So I raid my wifes purse when she's not looking
Pondering the wonderful thing called marriage
I accidentally back the car into a baby carriage
'scuse me ma'am I'd love to stay and chat
But watch where you're going next time you old bat
I hit the gas and zoom down the block
Leave 'er in the dust yellin' for the cops
Swervin' round a corner tryin' to steer
I get so excited I almost spill my beer
A neighbourhood dog is yappin' at my bumper
So I slam on the brakes and I hear a big thump
I jump the curb and land up on a lawn
Then I finish my beer and turn the radio on
Some idiot's goin' on about rehab
I grab a brew and yank on the pull tab
Here comes a little old lady with a shot gun
I put the pedal to the metal and she runs
Digging on my off-road driving power
I do a donut in a bed of flowers
Then I jerk the wheel a little to hard
The car rolls over and over on out of the yard

(Act the fool)

I come to rest in the middle of the street
A bunch of empty beer cans rattlin' at my feet
Starin' in the window is a nosy little brat
I look him in the eyes and say ""I meant to do that""
Then I notice my watch says I'm overdue
For my big appointment at the local drive through
I do a number on the accelerator
And I'm cuttin' in line about thirty seconds later
Whaddya think this is?
Some kinda joke?
Gimme 10 Big Macs and a small diet coke
I pull up to the window with my radio playin'
I grab the bag and leave without payin'
I weave down the road for a block
Jugglin' a beer and a a styrofoam box
Pull into a parking lot and kill the motor
Presently I notice a peculiar odour
A little black smoke is risin' from the hood
Somethings gonna happen and it's probably not good
I open the door grab my stuff and go
Just in time to watch the whole thing blow
The car explodes with a bang and a hiss
Oh boy, my wife is gonna really like this
I can't believe this is happenin' to me (Hot Damn!)
This piece of junk's goin' back to the factory
This was a blatant attempt on my life
Everyone will fall for that
Except my wife (Hot Damn!)
But wait a plan begins to emerge
I suddenly have an overwhelming urge
To spend the night in the great outdoors
My suburban lifestyle has become a bore
I'll build me a fire
And finish my burgers
What my wife don't know (Hot Damn!)
Won't hurt her
I leave the scene of the unhappy event
Resolved to make the most of my predicament
A few yards away I feel better
I know! I'll write 'er a letter
Or better yet a ransom demand
Got your husband send the money understand?
Or else we'll send his head home in a jar
P.S
Sorry 'bout the car
Yeah, now that ought to really do the trick
I'll be gettin' off the hook and she'll be worried sick
But really, I'm gonna make it up to you honey
I'll buy you a new car with your own damn money
I walk a while into the sunset
A man, at peace with the world, you bet
Nothing can diminish my total enjoyment
Except when I pass my place of employment

Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?
King for the day and he loves the road
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold

That's Frosty the Snowman
He's a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
So, down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

For Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

I never thought it would happen
With me and the girl from Clapham
Out on a windy common
That night I ain't forgotten
When she dealt out the rations
With some or other passions
I said, ""You are a lady""
""Perhaps,"" she said, ""I may be""

[Verse 2]
We moved into a basement
With thoughts of our engagement
We stayed in by the telly
Although the room was smelly
We spent our time just kissing
The Railway Arms we're missing
But love had got us hooked up
And all our time it took up

[Verse 3]
I got a job with Stanley
He said I'd come in handy
And started me on Monday
So I had a bath on Sunday
I worked eleven hours
And bought the girl some flowers
She said she'd seen a doctor
And nothing now could stop her

I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better
And when the time was ready
We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
With little kicks inside her

[Verse 4]
This morning at 4:50
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another

[Verse 5]
And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier
She left me when my drinking
Became a proper stinging
The devil came and took me
From bar to street to bookie
No more nights by the telly
No more nights nappies smelly
[Verse 6]
Alone here in the kitchen
I feel there's something missing
I'd beg for some forgiveness
But begging's not my business
And she won't write a letter
Although I always tell her
And so it's my assumption
I'm really up the junction4Embed",2,1,1

There must have been some magic

Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop

But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick (Ooo)
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel (Ooo)
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel (Ooo)

To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say

My wife's been sick, the young ones, too
And I'm darn near down with the flu
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The porch rotted down that's more expense
The darned old mule he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and I can't pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before i melt away""
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""catch me if you can""
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""

Had to hurry on his way

She wrote you a letter, you ain't never read it
Sat out on your doorstep since the day that she sent it
She had lots to say but the words just blew away
The letters got replaced with things she didn’t say

[Verse 2]
Nail a crow to the fence and behold death's romance
The rest of the murder bear witness from the telephone wires
Lost lovers and friends, well they will all attend
With roses and incense on the funeral pyre

[Chorus]
She wrote it all down with an eagle's feather
Dipped in cocaine and blood
A diamond needle on a broken record
Of a melody never sung

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You stumbled for hours over pages with gilded edges
Ink and newsprint smeared with cliffs, sharp ledges
The image you saw, out of focus and out of turn

Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?
King for the day and he loves the road
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold

That's Frosty the Snowman
He's a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
You might also likeOh, Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
So, down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

For Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

He crossed tha line, nigga dropped a dime
Then he ran to those white folks sayin' I tried
I Stunna one of a kind you muthafucka
Catch me in tha summer in a rag top hummer
Nigga pack yo tools, nigga pay yo dues
Been a G  about this gangsta shit, it ain't no rules
Nigga cook yo food, hard ki's we move
Then yo get up on tha stand & you cross yo dude
Let them people play you nigga, now it's time to lose
Got some killas in tha pen wanna give you tha blues
An on tha outside niggas do what they do
We in tha projects grindin' wit that girl or tha poo
Yo whole family ain't safe cause I'm killin' 'em too
I put a hit on every nigga that's close to you

I was raised around dope & crack fiends, stranglers & triple beams
You can not imagine all tha shit that a nigga seen
Now I done seen niggas get they head busted for nothin'
They leave & come back stuntin' like they bout it & wasn't
Better watch them some nigga or stop them some nigga
This a nigga wit a black hooded & pops them a nigga
The people came thru & they done kicked in my Ma's do'
They tore up my Ma's house & questioned my folks
My momma stood up & said ""Ain't no Lac here
Get yo dogs, get tha fuck out & don't come back here""
I'm tired of runnin', I can't turn back, I hear tha sirens comin'
Now they can give a lovely fuck why I done it
An all they need to prove is that I fired somethin'
Or hit 9 lil' children
My partna got killed & they say I'm the gunman

I was tha first nigga out tha click wit a cuban connect
An tha first to push a six thru tha Nolia project
I broke bread wit all my niggas gave 'em tha prices I get
Turn the projects to condeminiums & diamonds to begets
Was tha first to go to feds, I left my two month old daughter
Her momma said since I left my friends ain't passed a quater
When I rolled out same niggas was in my face again
Like "" Stone you out early, man we thought you got ten""
We kicked tha bo bo, swapped lies, given hugs & dap
But you know hugs ain't love, niggas is checkin' for straps
Each one of them owein' me a dub, ain't even mention tha snaps
I knew then it was bad blood, I'm bout to twist some caps
Gun in hand, I'm eatin' grits, I ain't done this in awhile
I see one in a blue sedan sharin' kisses & smiles
I creep up on him, popped tha van, ran thru tha crowd
Hit tha corner of Washington then I popped up his house

So you was all about tha rah rah shit back then
But yo money ain't long & you know you can't win

Talk too much I silence you (Silence)
I don't hear nothin', it's quiet for you (Shhh)

That's worse than a nigga being mad at you (Swear)
Watchin' Ja Morant get forty-four points
Courtside, in FedEx Forum with the fire (On me)
I fuck around and got caught up, my name got brought up
'Member that time in Dubai? (Lonely)
I had to try 'em one time with thе devil
I got for the low but they go for thе half (Finesse 'em)

In the long, dead-end of winter

Word em up

Got the E Double, right there
JMJ combined with Grand.. Royal..
Nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four
Word em up
Here we go, Joe Sinistr representin from the joint

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Yo yo, I pause for the cause
I seen niggas heads busted, someone pass the gauze
This rhyme may affect the skull to a point
And crash the membrane, so you should spark a joint
*inhale* There I go and now it's Showtime without
KiKi Shepherd, now the bitch feels neglected
Check the memo, remember you listened to my demo;
Yeah the one about the fuckin limo?
Rewind because I'm pushed for time right now
What where when how, my sound's out there like Moscow
I hear nuttin but the music, raw fusion
No mass confusion or illusion
Blink blink, blink so what you sayin?  I'm not playin
Hey man, yo I caught you playin
So don't be conspicous, cause you can't get with this
Hardcore scientifical, far from typical
My rap style, is dy-no-mite
It make you wanna be like the E Double, and not like Mike
Yo, bust my acoustics, SWING!
Deranged, when I rock the mic I feel strange
Now back to our program, fuck Batman, bang bang
Sound from the gat-man
Let me quit it, cause I feel I have shitted
And got mad niggas widdit
Joe Sinistr follows
So y'all get my dick, until tomorrow

[Verse 2: Joe Sinistr]
And while niggas still arrested virgins, I rips it ill
As Erick Sermon's, we's the ones usin the method slurrin
So Joe Sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews
My six will fix another one greedy
FORREAL, let's peel they hats back for deal slow
And we'll catch clown, with they pants down REAL LOW
The screwball better work a RuPaul and switch fast
Or we'll be in the cornfield, killin your bitch ass
And Timb's roam through bad bad odor but it is home
Wild flex and more sex than Mad Cobra
So take it easy ?just to mash a kraut? mine's the cheesiest
And I'm sworn to keep their eyes on more than CBS
I make the Funk Doobie turn to a process
I mob just any nigga, I don't care who he
I still get doughs, takin off bitches Girbauds
And lamp with Erick, a champ merit cause I flip foes
See these screws loose, I repeat, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
But stop there goes the third time with the cock-a-roach
And I get more flows than Vic Tayback
So kids, here come the second big payback

It's the second payback, Payback, Part II
Yeah, it's the second payback, The Payback, Part II

And howl at half moons and White Owls and mad tunes

My style is more Fear-ed than Black Planets
And I fuck your shit, suck my dick for explicit
I let clips at your name, pay rent in your brain
And I gets wicked, wick-wick-wicked
And keeps a full clip in case the bullets get evicted
And now to twirl up the fat nigga, seek psychiatric

At sixteen, spittin the green pea soup
And cock nines, when niggas got slime, the only men

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day
So he said
""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
"" Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
""Don't you cry

Squinting faces at the sky

She retweeting bout my dick
She got cameras on my bathroom
And she's peekin on my shit
Drove to LA just to tell me she want to get on my tip
Drove the whole way to NY to tell her friend I licked her lips
Now shes driving to Miami to tell you she takes her shit
Now shes driving to her hook up to say she fakes every shit
She thinks that she goin with me
But I leave her like some lit
Cause Im driving out to every bar I know there is a bitch
And she sits on top of my broom, now shes flyin like a witch
Every stripper find a pole when I come cause they know Im rich
Every bar I say is hotter than the previous I spit
I take planes to everywhere in Europe to take some few sips
And Im driving through the city, and them haters always trips
Damn, I killed this like Im Red Rum, haters know that Im the shit

But we thought it would be better, if she didn't say byebye
But the 3 years weve been hookin up, I guess that we were wrong
Im just tryna put you up some things, Thats why I wrote this song
And I made your girlfriend breakup with me, cause she found her thong
And this girl that I am talking up, Ill tell you later on
We were goin at it, like Tiger was cheating on his wife
Im a player, pussy is the most important in my life
And Im cuttin through this critics like warm butter and a knife
Now Im gonna tell you bout the girl I hooked up with last night
She came up to me while I was sippin rose in this bitch
Said her was Allison, or something, I just watched this bitch
Then she came up to me, said ""Hey M.D, I know that youre rich
But I bet that I can make you scream for my pussy like shit""
Then I said, ""Well I can get it on with you for just this night""
Ive been sippin champagne, I bet I make you feel alright

Cause an introvert party don't start

Now they say I'm not much of a people person
But I know how to party

Fridge is stocked with snacks and food
Music playlist sets the mood
Got a cooler full of booze
Friday night, this weekend's mine
It's finally time to let loose

It's introvert party time
Staying home and being lame
Introvert party time
Gonna read a book or play a video game
Introvert party time
Dodging social obligations
Introvert party time
Annoyed by conversations

What?
Hey! You watch the sportsball game?
He hit a touchdown and found the goal basket!

Disrupted by extroverts
This one way conversation burns
Assaulted by extroverts
You bring the yap, I bring the hurt
I'm hunted down by ""people people""
Before the call, my night was peaceful
A ""bad connection,"" the call was dropped
Cause you bring the talk
Talk talk talk talk talk

But I was tired...
You were my ride!

At the store waiting in line
Cheap tequila, salt, and lime
Texted by my friends all day
I'm giving in, I'm going out
Being social in my own way

It's introvert party time
At a barbecue playing on my phone
Introvert party time
Sneaking out the backdoor alone
Introvert party time
Let's get together some other day
Introvert party time
Gonna go back home and that's where I'll...

Hey man, you wanna go to a bar and throw darts at a circle?

Surrounded by extroverts
Small talk stalkers on high alert
Assaulted by extroverts
You bring the yap, I bring the hurt
Flanked left and right by ""people people""
Before the swarm my night was peaceful
I spot the exit, it's time to walk
Cause you bring the talk
Talk talk talk talk talk
Don't leave! I'll buy you a beer!
You want Original Piss or Piss Light?
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Your quiet disinterest makes me want to tell you all about myself!

Excuse me, your zipper's down

Leave me alone

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speak, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her and wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right

And I heard everything you’d say
Sometimes all I need is not that far away

Fell out of place today
I could tell by the rate of my heart
That I’d spent too much time awake
Sometimes all I need is just too hard to take

But I felt like I was suffering
So I chose to walk away
And now everytime you see me I’ll be tryna shift the blame

[Chorus]
No you don’t wanna touch me now
Or speak too loud
Feeling like the only one left in the room
If it gets brighter when the lights go down

Break undеr responsibilities
I’d be safe here if you ever would
So i’ll stay quiet on the way out

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

It's funny how one play can could put you in the mood for the day
A good one or a bad one depending on where you stay
Just let me know if it's safe
'Cause we done did shit that you can't erase
And fuck the shit I bought, I gave you game that you can't replace
You came up in a major way
Quit moving out of fear, started moving out of faith
You tell me that you heard our favorite song the other day
First, you was trying to leave, now you say you on your way
That's the price to pay, I guess that's what love cost
Just cause you walked out the door don't mean the love lost

Seen it at a concert (Shee), you called off work
Even bought the shirt
Was glad we was there for the crowd surf
We said that night, we both found our purpose
Had both our hands going in circles
Listened over and over
Trying to find out what the words was
It came from a band we never heard of
But now it's the soundtrack to our life
Rolled up all day to it, ride all night
Every time we turn it on, people say all kind of shit
Now you gone, go figure
So you better not play it for another niggaEmbed",2,2,2

Yo, I bring it home like HBO

Down to move your body with the ultimate tones
With the itchy trigger finger like Barnaby Jones
To set off a new method of hardcore material
Warm and unbelievable like Cream of Wheat cereal
To the night cap of rap you will adapt
I'm a lover so the girls wanna sit on my lap
And whisper in my ear, ""Where do we go from here?""
I say, ""I'm down to move your body, oh yes, my dеar""

Listen up everybody for the next hype party

So just like disciples, you all better repent
And move your body up and down, side to side
An occasional slide while the rhymes just glide
Tasty like a butter roll or filet of soul
With the beauty like a mole, but black is cold
As my attitude, far from rude, most definitely smooth going
And no one can stop me from flowing
And down to move your body 'cause I like to party

Grab your cup, Sweet & Low as I begin to flow

You gotta sit back, relax and max and listen close, son
And just maybe we can have some fun
'Cause I'm cool and calm, got a smile like my mom

Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

Woo!

I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at""

And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table

Oh no, babe

How should I feel when everything is you?

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together

The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks who have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you

Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes

I know that all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not the being one but the being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First

Grab the mic, look at the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two

Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""

Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes made here)

[Queen Latifah]
Who said that the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

[Monie Love]
My sister, can I get some?

[Queen Latifah]
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

[Monie Lovie]
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E
[Queen Latifah]
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""

Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first
Oooh, Ladies first, ladies first

Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next

Mister Sandman, Bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips, Like roses and clovers
Then tell him that his lonesome night is all over

[Verse 1: Nalyd Ecitsuj]
I don't fret for that emotional shit like most dudes do
Step on dog doo doo
While I'm pacing back and forth plotting to murder you
Pull a knife to your neck like Freddy Kruger boo
Snapbacks and Tattoos
I'm more into anthrax and barbed-wire baseball bats
Ew
Blood stain on my brand new shoe
Hope in my van let's role play
I'll be Bowser, You be the damsel in distress
Find a hero soon, This is not a test
I call you Princess Peach on Koopa Troopa Beach
Yeah I'm the faggot at the bus stop wearing his purple beats
I'm looking for acceptance
But I have no blessings
Ya'll know a God don't exist
If he did he wouldn't have have you that herpe cyst on your lips you cunt
Failed soccer player so I punt
Jump bunt cake in your hashtag face
You have never won against me in a freestyle race
You lucky to see Hi-de-ho Silver
In other words you were second place
Tonto to my Lone Ranger
You can bet your middle finger that I'm gonna be the reason you no longer breathe and linger
Tough to swallow like bee stingers in your throat
I have yellow teeth but I don't smoke
Maybe too much Pepsi Cola
There was never a Spanish pussy that i didn't pass over
Shopping at Kroger
Seen my arch enemies car so i key scratched his range rover
Matt Stover
This song already has a futbol reference
My preference to rap out loud to a crowd at lunch on a table
Quief gummy bears out my ass if I'm able
Fornicate with those Gangam Style horses if they are stable
King Mabel which makes me a man on a mission
Screaming yes while I hurt them call it vegan submission
Pull both they legs with Gonzalez which means we got they bones wishin'
Now I'm pissin' covered in gasoline
Like the apple core guy from Joe Dirt
Fuck is this dandruff
Who replaced my Head & Shoulders with Pert
No more flakes
Terry Crews has got shakes that'll make you quake
Anybody out there got that weed that'll get me baked
That's a lie I ain't ever smoked
Talking bout an orgasm you shoulda took another year of drama cause you clearly faked
Draped over your man tits is a triple XL shirt
She's a flirt with an Arabian boot nose
Yeah, Hi Jessica Sikes can we fuck I suppose?
I can strike a pose
While you walk like a body builder
My mouth needs a god damn filtah'
Aye that's enough make-up looking like a powdered donut
And look at my waist I'm hungry
Minus the beliefs and camo
So get with me the one with the flamboyant flow
The Scampoli Way is the route I wanna go
The SRealMcCoy Club
We have jackets & fedoras
Flip a coin
It's Witcher's heads & tails for Devora
I'm no stranger to a girl named Jasmine
Come cuddle on my carpet and call me Aladdin
Just like my pants these bars are never saggin'
Not much of a gamer but I can tell that you're laggin'
A Coleman always beside me beard scratchin'
Like i said earlier
Arabian homosapian, with another chance to see my mom raped again
Quit playing with your FireWire you butt nut
I went back in the pocket yelled no sack in my jock
Get it I'm discharging my laptop
Tweets hashtag fresh cut
You'll see a picture of me with a blonde flat top
What is this? Stop
I didn't ask for a monster, I just asked for a pop
Yellow light bulbs mean caution
I'm a lyrical prepubescent pussy my innocence just hasn't blossomed
Like a fresh spring flower
This thing cost money call it Power Hour
Tell Michelle Ang I wanna bang for an hour
She started screaming louder so I pulled out of her vage poucher
Her pussy tasted like sesame see chicken
Chickity China, The Chinese chicken
I'd rather be shitting than bitching
I wouldn't be caught dead burying hobo's in ditches
What is the meaning of the word truth when you use a cell phone and a computer as a booth
Welcome to the sermon
Jack off my chief little dick then jizz over the port bow
Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla Ice featuring track maybe?
Twitter war with Davey
Tell that cunt to drown in a Tampa Bay lake
He's just another Suckaneer flake
Backwards God i call that bitch Kandy
Need some useless information, just hit up Big Dandee
The day I make it is the same day I give a fuck about Shain Gandee
They call me The Sandman
Go to sleep in this casket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Now give me back my basket
Another eventual death and I just dropped my favorite hatchet
Oh you're still alive? Clean up the mess
Patch it

[Emcee(s): Apani B. Fly]
[Producer(s): Mike One]

[Verse 1: Apani B. Fly]
When am I gonna grasp the “happily ever after”?  That’s so
Soft, pa.  I always thought my life was gonna be more
I lost the swing of things, the scheme of things, know
Block to trooper, so I never got to spread my wings
I need direction ‘cause my head is in a mess
I need a priest, God bless, because I’m always under stress
I guess I’m in a bind.  Can you tell me who genuine?
I can’t trust myself, and I’m losing my goddamn mind
This psychosis is no joke, it’s like Jekyll and Hyde
I got a good side, just sometimes I’m just ferocious, demons
Threaten my presence.  Preserving my essence, so
I keep on stepping with heavenly blessings
I strive to live right to reach the afterlife, still
Evil persists, I attempt to resist, always
Clenching my fist when I’m walking the strip, sometimes
Losing my grip, that shit be having me high.  I don’t
Wanna, but it seems like I’m gonna succumb to
(The pressure) The pressure that I’m under

Day-to-day
Life is ninety percent stress, peace of mind
Is hard to find.  Nevertheless, I try
To chill.  Shit goes down ill, the will is steel, but for real
(Sometimes) it’s hard to deal, (fuck it) is how feel (True)
The grind has me trapped in, most friends ain’t worth having
Always backstabbing, so I roll mainly solo
Looking out for uno, I told Carlos, “You know
Them niggas, they’re fucking punks, and you can’t trust ‘em”
My brain is busting, yo, too many distractions disrupting
My flow, so I’m true to my own and leave them corns
Alone, although them devils wanna kill me, but my
Pops don’t even hit me and, still, G, all them dizzy
Betties involve me in all their silly conflicts, twisted plots
And scripts they invent, morals is bent ‘cause they
Never had shit, they live, the shot I smoke
A lot, Newports and pot, so I can better
Deal with the pressure (The pressure)

[Verse 3: Apani B. Fly]
Under pressure, will it ever get better?
Whatever the weather, gotta keep it together
I survive and maintain regardless of pain
Love burns, the world turns, but the bruises remain, it’s a shame
Families trife, money’s tight and hard to come by
At night, I close my eyes and see my young life flash by
Mental strain and migraine, I play the hard game, go through changes
Can you relate to exactly what I’m saying?  Fate is
Whimsical, so I stay spiritual.  True, I’m meta-
-physical, I’m holding for a miracle, the streets’ll ruin you
I’m running through crazy crew members for real
Now I’m one tough contender like steel, I spoke
To God, He said, “Be on your guard, dread, let the rockhard
See that you got heart, kid, and then they start shit”
Bring a spark to a stop quick, life’s thick
Keep your wits ‘cause one time or another
Word to mother, y’all might go under

Let me set this straight, this is NASA with an extra A
I put the pen in penetrate, let the ink stab the page
We rocket rocking test tube socks, I don't exagarate
Just a handful of astronauts bumpin' a boombox, let me demonstrate
We on air, no literally were on air
Shown on breaking news, ya'll just like a TV glare
You're just there, and incorrect, this is not clique
This is an Apollo mission movement we put the hop in hip
Make you flop like a floppy disk the minute you go to speak
We stand out like a poppy seed stuck in between your teeth
Go and ahead and insult me, but remember you are glue
What you say bounces off a satellite and sticks back to you
You are on the fence and the dog will come back to bite
So repress your douche tensions and you can sleep tonight
Matter of fact breathin' right, I'm just stating the factors
So count down from 10 and watch as we blow up, this is NA,SAA

Siamese Thai trees, scroll it up and try these
Mind read and psych see till our motherfuckin' eyes bleed
Rhyme free and time freeze, blast into lightspeed
Fly steeze, the tight breed, rarely do you find we
Behind me stands, a crew full of astronauts
No oxygen or consciousness inducing faster thoughts
Flaunting this obnoxious shit, lucid when we taking off
Intrude and make concoctions and forget about the antidote
Rappers man... I really ain't a fan of those
Y'all are too fast to move past and brand it dope
Welcome to this land of hope, open up and pan the scope
Focus on the man that spoke the potent brand of quotes
Stand and Toke, Outside your local businesses

Rhyming as hard as five vikings on a Vicodin binge
We breed carnage with fiend carcasses carved in a bin

Immortals passing through portals, I'll show you what paranormal is
Dreading this given glory like Dorrien
Saying that we the shit so we even leave 'em in porcelain
Harder than barnacles, more than these whores have bargained for

Hi there, it's Psyrus, I wrote this on papyrus
The pacifier hieroglyphs' for you to suck like Linus
Hot enough to kill a germ or clear the Nanny's sinus
At the moment, I'm just waiting for the mindless to find this
And when they stumble on it, they'll be so dumbfounded
That it makes a humble bum out of Columbus
Genocide for those opposed to trying out this Hummus
Started underground but told the hikers we'll be at the summit
Now we're standing tall among the dead, similar to fungus
Sense is being made although I had no magic fungus
Prosperity for posterity has always been among us, it's just
The popularity of genuinely dirty, flirty-with-the-beat nerdy kids
Is Leslie's birdie when it's 30 and darker than the Cosby kids

Equal opportunity 6 snacking savages
Terrorize communities gnarling on packages
Peaceful with no mutinies drooling with no damages
Tranquilize immunities, bargin' where the mattress is
Twist up the member get fixed and stop it
Six in the chamber nah six in the cockpit
Conscious when the hominids hopped to a new conglomerate
Silence when I'm counting heads see how limited options get
Brainwave length but see how wide
Extrasensory perception lets me blow minds
Implode or rewind contrast blind eyes
Bonsai blast holes through my minds confines
Scatter all my bygones connected with a nylon
Sleeper spell is really just a comatose pylon

So what's a couple minutes more? When you're tired, when you're poor

I'm Atlas Telamon and I speak these valid truths
With the cuts from the roofs of our mouthes, (WORD)

Was that I would disappoint all the ones I love
But I’ve been there and back

Climbed up the waterspout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again

The itsy bitsy spider
Climbed up the kitchen wall
Swoosh! went the fan
And made the spider fall
Off went the fan
No longer did it blow
So the itsy bitsy spider
Back up the wall did go

The itsy bitsy spider
Climbed up the yellow pail
In came a mouse
And flicked her with his tail
Down fell the spider
The mouse ran out the door

She slipped on some dew

I hope you know you’re home to me
With your hands around my heart

And after all
The little things you say may be so unfair
Got your fingers tangled in my hair
It’s like I’ve never known my worth
And when you lie, it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been waiting for you

I guess that I found
Another reason I’ve been holding my smile
When you’re not around
I could never try to get through to you
There’s a rhythm in what we have

Slowly dancing, wounds are mending
I feel
Your body shaking
You think my love’s unsure
I’ll be the one to judge
You might also likeBut I’ll suffer the fall for love

You
Don’t have to catch me
You
I hope that you’ll learn
What it’s like to hurt
When you fall too low
And when you lie it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been waiting for you

I guess that I found
What it means to be with you

I know that it’s true
Why you walking away?
I’ll be there when you fall
I’m not gonna be here some day
Don’t you waste what I have
Tell me where you wanna go
Let me know
When you know
I’ll be waiting right here for you
Feeding off my love
Addicted to my touch
I don’t wanna be the one to give it all
I don’t wanna be the one to give it all

Pending on my love
I’ve given all my trust
Love you, no typo
And when you lie it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault

Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Where are you now when I need you most?

Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh

Why'd I think that you would let me in?
Why does wanting you feel like this?
Talk so much but I never get a word in edgewise
I made you come in so you couldn't stay

O'er them distant murmurs dying,
Ocean caves beneath replying
From mermaid's horn
To echoes borne
On winged breeze
O'er land and seas
From Asgard, Midgard, Jötunheim.
Gently rocking to and fro,
Aegir's daughters ceaseless go;
Mantles blue the maidens wear,
Snow-white bosoms gleaming bare,
Sea-grass green their floating hair,
Still onward rolling, keeping time.

Who so fair as the waves,
Aegir's daughters.
Dancing waters!
Lapping lightly on the land,
Sporting softly on the strand,
Chasing one another.
Then the breeze, their brother,
Ruffles their crests,
Scatters their spray,
While their billowy breasts.
Heaving high in their play,
Swell and throb! In coral caves
Reigns King Aegir,
Feasts the Aesir,
Feasts he, too, the drownéd Ones
Hither brought by Ran, his queen,
Swathed in shrouds of sea-weed green,
Fringed with shells; while still the sheen
Of pallid limbs and whit'ning bones
E'er ghastly through the meshes comes
Of the net, in which each day
Unwary sailors catches she,
Grim Sea King's guests below to be.
Who so fierce as the waves,
When, from deep ocean caves,
Aegir shall call,
Shall summon all
To bear his fury on high!
Madly raging, roaring, lashing,
'Gainst steep crags in wild wrath crashing,
Up to Heav'n their spray-clouds dashing,
Mingling sea and sky!

Hither comes Thor,
The Thunderer,
To sport with those maids at rest.
Sleepily lies each maiden calm,
Gently drifting, with snow-white arm
Folded on billowy breast;
Foam-wreaths over the floating hair,
Swelling surges murmuring e'er
Lullaby songs that soothe to rest.

But fierce Thor,
The Thunderer,
Loves no calm!
Peace has no charm
To lull his soul to rest.
Comes he hither to sport an hour.
In Jötun's land,
With mighty hand,
His Aesir power
Rang in the rock
In tempest shock,
And raised dread fear in giant's breast.
What Odin sought,
That strong Thor wrought;
And, now returned
For sport he burned
E'er yet he reached Bilskirnir's bower.
From their rest the maids are waking,
Dimpling smiles o'er soft cheeks breaking,
Sparkling showers from fingers shaking, —
Foamy fingers, light and fair;
While bright Day from car of gold
Scatters gems of price untold
To bedeck each virgin rare.
Clinging, clasping in caresses.
To his breast the great God presses
Each soft maid, while floating tresses
Wrap him in embraces cold.

Burning Thor, with kisses fierce,
Will their frozen bosoms pierce,
Seizes in enfolding arms;
Filled with passion, strong desire,
Lustful flames e'er mounting higher,
Presses wildly yielding forms,
Riots on their sparkling charms.
Lightly still the maids caress him.
Closer to their bosoms press him;
Strange regrets and vague alarms
Wake too late! now, filled with storms
Of wild wrath, they vainly try
From his mighty arms to fly.
More gently does their lover Thor,
To lie at peace the maids implore;
But struggling, rising in their rage.
While all the ocean powers engage
To free them from the Thunderer,
At length his wrath they rouse;
Then ends in strife the rude carouse.
Fiercely the billows strive,
Madly they toss and writhe,
'Neath towers of froth they hide;
While all the ocean wide
Is lashed in boiling surge.
Aegir sits trembling on his throne,
For power to match with Thor is none.
Now, from their towers the maids emerge,
Now, driven back by tempest scourge.
Rough, wild waters!
True Jötun daughters!
Roaring, wrestling, battling, writhing,
Evil powers 'gainst Aesir striving;
Now, lost 'neath walls of foaming froth,
Now, darting swift high billows forth!
Blinded by the spray they pour.
Deafened by their sullen roar.
Mighty Thor,
The Thunderer,
Flashes lightnings, rolls his thunder.
Tears their billowy arms asunder.
Undoes their fiercely clinging clasp.
Upholds them firmly in his grasp.
Upholds them high
'Neath lowering sky,
Rampant raging, shrieking shrill,
Holds them powerless at his will;
Still the maidens higher lifts.
Dashes 'gainst the frowning cliffs, —
Dashes with his gathered strength!
His wrath appeased, he turns at length.
And muttering in his red beard low,
While glaring still from bended brow.
Home to Bilskirnir wends he slow;
With mocking laughter doth he go.Embed",0,1,1

[Parte I: Teléfonos]

[Verso]
Night is down in insect town
I'm sitting glued to the glowing tube
Tedious tedium, it's slow and slow
About the craving for something I could really use

We're worker ants and we're ants with wings
Saying ""God I'm high"" or ""Christ, I'm late""
Asking girls and women
""Won't you show me the way
To the crumpled sheets and naughtier things?""

But it's sad, it's so sad
Old people shouldn't take it quite so bad, I know
But it's sad, sad, sad

Well, the sadness of a long dead star on late night TV
The sadness of shooting away your gloom
And of old crumpled men in their one-day suits
And telephones ringing in empty rooms

All the birds have flown from the park uptown
And a family I know has built an ark
It's been raining long in a steady flow
And newspaper headlines read bad and stark
You might also likeIt's sad, it's so sad
Old people never had it quite so bad
But it’s sad, sad, sad

Well the sadness of a long dead star on late night TV
The sadness of shooting away your gloom
And of old crumpled men in their one-day suits
And telephones ringing in empty rooms

There are ten things you need to know

Number one!

[BURR]
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Number two!

[BURR]
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

[COMPANY]

I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

[BURR]
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[BURR]
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

[BURR AND PHILIP & HAMILTON]
Near the same spot (Near the same spot)
Your son died, is that (My son died, is that)
Why—(Why—)
[COMPANY]
Six!

[BURR]
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[BURR]
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

[BURR]
They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter
[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[BURR]
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

[COMPANY]
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—
[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye
Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza

My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

[BURR AND COMPANY]
He aims his pistol at the sky—

[BURR]
Wait!
[BURR]
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah

Angelica and Eliza—
[BURR]
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

You're still restoring, redeeming everything

May Your will be done in me

Let it wash away the pain

Feel the weight fall off our shoulders
As our hearts respond in praise
To the God who reigns forever
And ever, amen

[Verse 1]
Time and time
I've thought through it all
How we loved and laughed
And how we fought each other
Pushing one another to be somebody else
And time and time
I've wrestled my thoughts
Uncertain if the end was right or wrong
And whether we still should be together
Or with somebody else

[Verse 2]
Our last memory
She had water in her eyes
She cried, ""Stay with me!""
And asked, ""How can this be love if you're leaving me?""
But darling, love's to blame

[Chorus]
And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't fake it
Can't be near you right now

That we had to break
And even though I knew your heart so well

Though we live a mile apart

But I will always remember the years we spent in love

[Verse 4]
I still think of you
I pray that you are safe
I'm still missing you
But it has to be this way
'Cause I'm not right for you
And that's why love's to blame

She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time, it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough

Solomon was the father, the casketmaker
In 1920 something, he was the undertaker
Who outlived everyone until the day he tried to die
And jumped in the freezing water so starts the timeline
1980 something one summer evening
Come out that same water he came ah-creeping
Wtih tattered clothes soaking wet from head to toe
Where he happened he had not know, no boots
Solomon was lost and confused in different times
He knew he didn't belong he could see it in her eyes
So he fled in the alleyway like the homeless
Cause at this point in time his life was hopeless
Killing himself didn't work a bit
He only woke up 60 years in the future, revived his shit
Alive was dead still waiting to become the transformation into Blaze's son

[Chorus:]
I keep changing feeling strange and watch as
I metamorphosize, well

He live by the gun, and died over trying to sell one
To a baby G, from a set around the way
Things are way different now, from way back in the days
Solomon would have never sold a piece
He'd only build a couple caskets
The house, alter the season
Blaze on the other hand, loved killing everything
And then what he took, to get his hands on some money man
From selling crack rocks, on street blocks
Hood famous as a dead thug
Always rocking a clock
Following numbers up the clock, making doorways
So anyone who would oppose, would die and just go away
He never died, no his wounds never healed
Never stopped to think, how shitty that got to feel
But it's okay, cause he's changing again
To fulfill the destiny, of Colton Grundy's brethren

Colton is the great one, never will he perish
He's not concerned with the life, that so many cherish
Not concerned with looking for love, that they claim that is
He's heartless, he dead, he's proud, he's not embarrassed
Move back, no time, the clock is broke
Never had parents, he was conceived in smoke
Father was just a premonition of a past life
Or the life he never stopped living
His story began right, it didn't
Still confused and I don't get it
He is I, and I am him, I never had decendents
I never had any father, and I am like my brother

Check it out (What?)

Looptroop, hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Hated by everyone
(Yeah, yeah)

Yo, all I see is MCs spreading wackness, preaching slackness
But your bullshit couldn't make me doin' one track less
Unless you take me out physically
'Cause mentally you're 2000 years behind with your flow-delivery
Actually, your cast is like an archeological discovery
From ancient times, way beyond known history
I'm CosM.I.C and my troop won't do it your way
We rock live, make fire alarms go off from Norway to Broadway
MCs in the hallway stand by
Microphone connected network, can't you see it's a busy line?
I ain't got time to deal with jealousy
Cause having that disease inside of me been killing me
Plus fans been feeling me from cities to farms
All around this God forsaken planet we walk upon
Bring it on, I break you down easy like cracking crayons
Cosmic, the audio rumblepak in your headphones

[Supreme]
Yo, yo, yo, ain't no way you can rock after these MCs
No way you make heads bob like these em' beets
And please, you don't want beef, you don't wanna try
Even with that extra chromosome, I think you know why
Supreme's why we put some extra work on the make-up
Like Sway and Tech, we gotta show the makeups we make suckers wake up
See I'm a floor filler, you're a floor killer for sure
The only way you move the crowd is out the door
The poor flow and off-beat delivery
Facing your disc jockey constantly mumbling “Hey yo, feelin' me?”
Not really, you'se like a playboy flick
It's never get to see no action, we want hardcore shit
“Looptroop” That's it, the rest of them sit quiet
David versus Goliath, we turn the party to a riot
My crew will occupate the building, barricade the doors
Once the beat kicks in, you'll understand (Understand)

[Promoe]
(Yeah) Promoe's a problem to the western world like the Y2K
Giving the president's wife toothache
From sucking on my sugar daddy long dick all night
She wanna take it even, I was like ""alright""
I turn superstars into super hoes like Scott la Rock
Promoe's an urban legend like Soda and Poprock
I don't cockblock, I cut off dickheads like Bobbitt
If you don't bob it, Looptroop shit, you can't stop it
You can cop it or copy it, either ways you gotta have it
Listening to our shit has become an alarming habit
Of today's youth, haha, seekers of the truth
No wonder they stumble over this boy group
Sent from outer space to make the world better
'Cause MCs act schizophrenic like the 23rd letter
Mission: exterminate every wack rapper, backstabber
Get more fame and sell more records than ABBA (Haha)
That's what I'm after and if you go after
Me on the microphone, you get nothing but laughter
Your DJ's cutbacks stinking like buttcracks
You got skills, I got two words: fuck that

I'm always so alone
Even when surrounded
By people that I know
I'm always so astounded
By my ability to ruin everything
Losing friends and starting fires
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
I always stay at home
'Cause I'm not good in public
I sit here on my phone
I'm always disappointed
I watch them live their lives
I wish that I were happy
Victim of my generation
Time machines cannot erase it

Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

I, I-I, I, I-I
I've been thinking about you on this airplane
And my, my mind is in the sky
When I'm dreaming about you on this airplane

[Verse 1]
Could it be the elevation?
Must admit that I'm not used to feeling these sensations
Missing you like crazy though it's barely been a minute
You dropped me to the gate
And bid farewell
Summer in Sevilla
Drinking red sangria by the fountain in the square
Imagine that you're seated with me
That we're flying there
But you're way back where, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I, I-I, I, I-I
I've been thinking about you on this airplanе
And my, my mind is in the sky
When I'm dreaming about you on this airplanе

There's no need for entertainment
TV screens be beaming
But you're my preoccupation
Kill the thirteen hours
Rummaging through every brain cell
Memories replaying in my mind
And boy, have you started changing?
Wonder who we'll be
The next time that I see your face
And I get so damn scared
When I think you're gon' outpace me
Think you're gon' replace me, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Yeah-hey, yeah, yeah)

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

[Chorus: Zac Efron]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight

[Verse 2: Zendaya]
You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

Baby to tell you the truth, I'm doing not well
Pains draping all over my body like felt
And my colors so pale, it's matching pastel
Been drawing myself, and it's way out of line in my mind
Repelling away, the people who love me, I find
I'm deep into hell and I still wonder why
I never break down and cry
I wish that I could but I can't and I tried, I swear
My eyes taped shut, since you came in my life I'm awarе
That I lost my sight, and I'm not alright with this 20/160
Can't even see if therе's somebody with me, I feel so alone to be honest
The scars that you left me are weighing down deep on my conscious
Tired of nonsense, I don't need comments
I'm sad and I know it, you set me in motion
And now I don't know if I'll recover from blocking emotions I don't wanna feel

Tempted to drink all my problems away
Just fade away into dusk

So I substituted with taking some drugs
Weed and the booze and the pills, I tried it all and still I don't feel any better

Solomon was the father, the casketmaker
In 1920 something, he was the undertaker
Who outlived everyone until the day he tried to die
And jumped in the freezing water so starts the timeline
1980 something one summer evening
Come out that same water he came ah-creeping
Wtih tattered clothes soaking wet from head to toe
Where he happened he had not know, no boots
Solomon was lost and confused in different times
He knew he didn't belong he could see it in her eyes
So he fled in the alleyway like the homeless
Cause at this point in time his life was hopeless
Killing himself didn't work a bit
He only woke up 60 years in the future, revived his shit
Alive was dead still waiting to become the transformation into Blaze's son

[Chorus:]
I keep changing feeling strange and watch as
I metamorphosize, well
Time keeps ticking in the Timeline
Ticking in the time keeps ticking in the timeline
Ticking in the
He is the father and I am the son
And together we become the great undying one, well

He live by the gun, and died over trying to sell one
To a baby G, from a set around the way
Things are way different now, from way back in the days
Solomon would have never sold a piece
He'd only build a couple caskets
The house, alter the season
Blaze on the other hand, loved killing everything
And then what he took, to get his hands on some money man
From selling crack rocks, on street blocks
Hood famous as a dead thug
Always rocking a clock
Following numbers up the clock, making doorways
So anyone who would oppose, would die and just go away
He never died, no his wounds never healed
Never stopped to think, how shitty that got to feel
But it's okay, cause he's changing again
To fulfill the destiny, of Colton Grundy's brethren

Colton is the great one, never will he perish
He's not concerned with the life, that so many cherish
Not concerned with looking for love, that they claim that is
He's heartless, he dead, he's proud, he's not embarrassed
Move back, no time, the clock is broke
Never had parents, he was conceived in smoke
Father was just a premonition of a past life
Or the life he never stopped living
His story began right, it didn't
Still confused and I don't get it
He is I, and I am him, I never had decendents
I never had any father, and I am like my brother
To sum it all up, we're all the same motherfucka

And my colors so pale, it's matching pastel
Been drawing myself, and it's way out of line in my mind
Repelling away, the people who love me, I find
I'm deep into hell and I still wonder why

That I lost my sight, and I'm not alright with this 20/160
Can't even see if therе's somebody with me, I feel so alone to be honest
The scars that you left me are weighing down deep on my conscious
Tired of nonsense, I don't need comments
I'm sad and I know it, you set me in motion

Tempted to drink all my problems away
Just fade away into dusk

So I substituted with taking some drugs
Weed and the booze and the pills, I tried it all and still I don't feel any better

Comfort for all those who mourn
For the broken hearted

Release from prison and shame
Oppression turning to praise
For every captive

Breaking the curse of the night
For all in darkness

Luminous language and what was said

Our future's terminal and anything good will do

We will do it today and then throw it away

And these are the records

These are the friends

These are the monuments

Dreams never end

Fans and scrappy cassette sounds

Pagan ampex spectral clouds

Something is missing

Something is missing

Unwilling to bend our knees
You might also likeBut willing to burst into flame

In Washington state or Newcross Gate

Always remember the failures

Always remember and tell us when you do

Tell us when you do

A stereo's as cheap as it takes

Our bookshelves full of mixtapes

Of punk and soul and damaged rock 'n roll

The Go-Betweens and Supremes

And the Chills and the Dills

Something is missing

Something is missing

Remember the lost bands that never had a hope
Checks and Credits by Toulouse

It was scratchy, it was great

Unseen history of these bands

Like a building built on fertile land

But I own that fanzine and the 45s

And I promise not to let them die

And in the skin of the world

We're like a heartbeat

Our rotten teeth like cobblestones

In the pathway of forgotten things

Haunted all our favorite bars

And nurtured hard our daydream scars

Something is missing
Something is missing

Change of river, running back to the sea

Detour this to the heart of the dream

Thank you, that guitar (?) to words

Amplify tears and rusty badges

Fingerprint photograph smudges

Our mixtapes are memories for unseen histories

And mixtapes are memories for unseen histories

What means the most to you, it means the most to me

What means the most to you, it means so much to me

And something is missing

Something is missing

I put my tongue in my mouth

A bit of black tooth comes out

This happens monthly

Rotten footsteps to goodbye

We found this out in the underground

And we felt so proud to be on the ground

And something is missing

And something is missing

And something is missing

And something is goneEmbed",0,1,0

Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys

A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

With no hungry children, no empty hand

I remember the beginning
When I found the secret place
Don’t know why it felt familiar
But I knew it right away
There were times it seemed so simple
And sometimes so unsure
But not a moment was ever wasted
Knelt behind those closed doors

VERSE 2:
‘Cause the secret place is secret
That’s where it gets its name
It’s not hiding but it’s hidden
Far from all religious games
No it won’t bring recognition
Or get called up on a stage
‘Cause the melody is sacred
You sing in the secret place

VERSE 3:
It’s an open invitation
No words you have to say
If you want it you can get there
There’s a thousand different ways
There’s no glory in the method
None are right and none are wrong
You just put your trust in Jesus
And then start to sing along
You might also likeVERSE 4:
‘Cause just as you are you’re welcome
There’s no part you have to play
Doesn’t need to be impressive
Couldn’t do that anyway
‘Cause when it gets too complicated
That melody will fade
But if you take the time to listen
You can hear heaven’s refrain

VERSE 5:
There’ll be days that it feels distant
So far beyond my reach
Like my failures locked the entrance
And my spirit lost the keys
But the beauty of the secret
That I’m so grateful for
Is that Your presence doesn’t need me
To kick down an open door

VERSE 6:
So I’m running to the secret
I’m going there today
Got no reason not to worship
And get undignified again
There’s no time for inhibitions
Or to care what people say
I won’t waste another minute
Take me to the secret place
BRIDGE:
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
With my life laid down
I’m surrendered now
I give You everything

The weighted clouds coming by
Has me looking right here under the sky
And I left my home
Passed the evening fires
In the blink of an eye
I had closed the door behind me

[Verse 2]
The vapor of old love
Will transfigure through a veil of clarity
I sense my grave
Way below the mire

[Verse 3]
Sorrow will find you
Its voice has given way to mine
Heart pumps death into our heredity
Who wants to come with me?

[Chorus]
For every dream that is left behind me
I take a bow
With every war that will rage inside me
I hear the sound
Of another day in this vanishing life
Returned to dust
And every chance I pushed away
Into the night

Luminous language and what was said

Our future's terminal and anything good will do

We will do it today and then throw it away

And these are the records

These are the friends

These are the monuments

Dreams never end

Fans and scrappy cassette sounds

Always remember and tell us when you do

Of punk and soul and damaged rock 'n roll

The Go-Betweens and Supremes

And the Chills and the Dills

Something is missing

Something is missing

Remember the lost bands that never had a hope
Checks and Credits by Toulouse

It was scratchy, it was great

Unseen history of these bands

Like a building built on fertile land

But I own that fanzine and the 45s

And I promise not to let them die

And in the skin of the world

We're like a heartbeat

Our rotten teeth like cobblestones

In the pathway of forgotten things

Haunted all our favorite bars

And nurtured hard our daydream scars

Something is missing
Something is missing

Change of river, running back to the sea

Detour this to the heart of the dream

Thank you, that guitar (?) to words

Amplify tears and rusty badges

Fingerprint photograph smudges

Our mixtapes are memories for unseen histories

And mixtapes are memories for unseen histories

What means the most to you, it means the most to me

What means the most to you, it means so much to me

And something is missing

Something is missing

I put my tongue in my mouth

A bit of black tooth comes out

This happens monthly

Rotten footsteps to goodbye

We found this out in the underground

And we felt so proud to be on the ground

And something is missing

This land is barren and broken
Scarred like the face of the moon
Our tongue is no longer spoken
And the towns all around face ruin
Will there be work in New Brunswick?
Will I find gold in the Cape?
If I tunnel way down to Australia
Oh, will I ever escape?

Where there's a mine or a hole in the ground
That's what I'm heading for, that's where I'm bound
So look for me under the lode and inside the vein
Where the copper, the clay, the arsenic and tin
Run in your blood and under your skin
I'll leave the county behind, I'm not coming back
Oh, follow me down, cousin Jack

The soil is to poor to make Eden
Granite and sea left no choice
Though visions of heaven sustained us

They appear in the night
They're here for my life
The fear's like lightning
Sears in the fright
I want to make one thing clear if I might
I'm no hero, I'm a sparrow in flight

No I'm no shield, I'm surreal in a fight
Feel like a fraud with the steel in my right
But I hear the advice of my sensei
And the shame is the only thing that's real in my life

What are you doing
You're running away
I'm sorry, I know, but I gotta keep moving
You're coming of age

You're the defender, serving a people at home and afraid
I'm a pretender, I don't deserve to be
I don't deserve to be holding this blade

I don't deserve anything
Shouldn't really be living on top of the earth
No, what are you doing, you're giving, you're giving
And what am I doing, I'm making it worse

Out of my element, dwell in anxiety

If you prefer, but be sure that your piety
Isn't deserved, I'm a burden, disquieting
Sure but I'm learning my worth in society
I'm sort of a fake, sort of a whelp
I'm sort of a vacant mourner to help
Scorned when I take the sword I've been dealt
But nobody hates me more than myself

Sleep next to me
Fill my cup with a dream
And watch me pull 'em down
It's a draining feeling
There's a lack of color here
Does it blind you, make you scared?
Watch me pour it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And do you want to listen to me lying?
'Cause it can't be a surprise that
In the darkness, it's blind, but we're not holding on to light
And you can blame it on the timing
See me clear in different lighting
But the truth here, is that love, you never learn

So give me all your love, love
And you can watch me pour it down
Give me all your lovе, love

Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious

And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

Soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
As this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
And the mid-nightmare trampling of dreams

But oh, no tears please
Fear and pain may accompany death
But it is desire that shepherds its certainty
As we shall see

She was divinity's creature that kissed in cold mirrors
A queen of snow, far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere
Dark liquored eyes, an Arabian nightmare

She shone on watercolors of my pond life as pearl
Until those who couldn't have her, cut her free of this world

That fateful eve when the breeze stank of sunset and camphor
Their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
An inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
On my love picking rue by the light of the moon

Putting reason to flight or to death is their way
They crept through woods mesmerized
By the taffeta ley of her hips that held sway
Over all they surveyed save a mist on the rise
A deadly blessing to hide her ghost in the fog
They raped and left, five men of God, her ghost in the fog

Then this I screamed ,""Come back to me
For I was born in love with thee
So why should fate stand in between?""

And as I drowned her gentle curves
With dreams unsaid and final words
I espied a gleam trodden to earth
The church bell tower key
The village mourned her by the by
For she'd been a witch, their men had longed to try
And I broke under Christ seeking guilty signs
My tortured soul on ice

A queen of snow
Far beyond compare

She was Erzulie possessed
Of a milky white skin
My porcelain yin
A graceful angel of sin

Best reserved for judgement that their bible construed

Putting reason to flight
Or to flame unashamed

I've lost the plot again, tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state, so come on down, you empty lovers
(Worms come out of the woodwork) And the snakes start to sing

[Verse 1]
Do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill, did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business

[Chorus]
Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

[Verse 2]
Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause Heaven's full and Hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well, you could lock me up in your heart and throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?
I'm just a woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business
Woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be

If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour, the apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?

[Verse 1]
Sharpening blades in dreams of terror
Your fury is what you are
Increasing lust of a living hate
Again and again in a physical pain

Her profanation's ready
The sacrifice is on its way
The resonating screams arise
Until she dies, in her own blood
She's drowning down
Can't escape from your own nature
Forever's who you are!

[Verse 2]
Drain all her will to resist without any respect
The scars you've done will be impressed like a mark on her back
A desecration's coming
The eyes you've never seen are closed
The sound of her breath drifts away
Forever gone

[Chorus]
Burn!
Forever burn
All her dreams
She feels lost and facing the insanity
We're lost in this pain
Her whisper is fading away
Destiny won't forgive
Forgive the one who lead to the unmerciful fate!

Stalking preys with frantic sadism
Your evil's satisfied
Incoming will to devastate
Again and again in a critical haze

The snow white skin is burning
Impurity for all to see
Her shattered body is on the ground
Until she dies, in her own blood
She's drowning down
Can't escape from your own nature

And commit most of the evil they preach against

I must be silent
Must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you

But they're like the people chained up in the cave
In the allegory of the people in the cave by the Greek guy

Bad little bitch, remind me of Betty boop

When I ride it cuz I ain’t lazy
He know that she don’t phase me
And I got him tripping talking bout he want my baby
Too bad I ain’t Jayda I don’t want no Lil baby
I want a check show me how to get this bread
If we ain’t gеtting money I told you this shit is dead
Come corrеct I promise you’ll get checked don’t tolerate disrespect


Fly me out just cuz I’m fly and I’m fine

He said I paint the perfect picture like a bitch could really paint

Shawty off the lean
Bad bitch Billy Jean
She a Virgo queen
Watch us when we hit the scene
Use to roll a dice now I’m cold as ice
Got me hypnotized lookin in her eyes
High on love, high on drugs, name yo price
She be on bullshit, hittin me back like talk to me nice
All the bad bitches to the right
They just tryna blow on my mic
I’m just tryna go all night
Kill the pussy dead on sight
They love me cuz I’m so front
And I keep somethin a lil special in the blunt
I don’t really give a fuck what you want
4th round, 4th down, beat it up, then I punt
That mean I gotta kick her
Cuz I know she only want me for the Snicker
And she had her moment
Beating on these bitches man I really don’t condone it
Don’t get it confused
Dream Or Die nigga stop living on snooze
Turnin me off like the mufuckin news
That’s why I like my bitches in 2’s
I don’t send no flowers, I be sending them nudes
Hit it from the back while I’m gripping on the boobs
She drink it out the cup I ain’t talkin bout the booze
Boney ass nigga but I eat it like food
Beat it up, then I’m gone, now you hurt boo hoo

You've been stuck in my head and girl I really wanna talk now
Chill at your place but every day you would walk out
Uh, kept cool can we calm down, anger in flames, slapped in the face with your palm
I don't know what to do and it's late and I'm tired
And you're on my mind, take a hit to feel higher
Text you again when I'm feeling inspired
I've recognized I'm reigniting the fire
Ay, what you want to do with me
I heard you telling everybody that you cool with me
But like you never text back
Every night relapse on the pain but you never let your parents see that
Now you stuck in a cycle of fuck-ups and jealousy
In my livestream, hit me up just to yell at me
Wow, think of the times you were hesitant
Thoughts about me, hope you know they're indefinite

For anybody that's wondering what my mind is
That shit's just solitary confinement
Open-minded, but my mind's been lost
And I'm really just trying to find it
Yeah we're magnets just trying to manage attraction
Damage and shattered to fragments
Love like a spiral I'm just trying to catch it
But I guess I suck and I just need some practice
And I'm wishing I could rip you out  my head like my hair
Yeah, If I was dead would you even care
If I had a funeral would you be there
Sometimes I wonder what colors you'd wear
Would you move on and tell yourself that you're strong
While you let me fade as I'm dead and I'm gone
Will you hold it down 'til you meet me and God
Or love someone else and leave me to be lost
I thought for life meant for life until momma remarried three times
I never saw through the lines
Growing up I thought that life would be fine
Now I'm just watching as everything dies

You know I think you're great
You’re fun
You don't take shit from anyone
And you only do things if you really fucking love it
Really fucking love it
And nothing's wrong, per se
But I’m a loner with a lot of baggage
That I haven't yet claimed
Don't want you to take that blame
It's not easy for me to say

[Chorus]
Breathe
Give me space to breathe
Walked in your steps too long
Forget who I was on my own
Please
It's not you it's me
Don't take it as goodbye
I still want you in my life
But I just need some space to breathe

[Verse 2]
Nothing's changed at all
In the last five hours since you texted me
And asked me what was going on
I’ve been sitting on my couch
I don’t want to go out
And put on a show for anyone
And when I say anyone
I really mean anyone
It's not just you
I don’t want to see my friends
My family, my mother
Don't get upset with me
I need to

Yeah
Fake people in my life, they’re all around me
And fake love seems to be all they’re offering
Bottom feeders in disguise, tryna harm me
Paranoia’s the only thing it’s caused me
I feel so alone on this path I’m walkin'
It’s just me and God and we keep on talkin'
I’m beggin' him: ""please get these demons off me!""
Can’t fight 'em anymore, 'cause it’s exhausting
I just wanna feel normal without trauma attached
I just wanna feel my heart, a piece of it's detached
I just wanna feel some real love that isn’t an act
I just wanna feel alive and snap out of this trance
These up's and downs overwhelm until I collapse
There’s no one to talk to, so I spill in my raps
I’m missin' the old me, somebody bring him back
In search of anyone sharing the feelin's I have, damn
Misfortunes to fortunes, inspiring
They say just be happy, I tried to be
I think my system needs, re-wiring
'Cause every other day I, am spiraling
In a dark abyss and it feels like home
'Cause it’s the only place that I’ve known
Suppressing my feeling that I don’t show
Until I’m bitter and I self-loath, damn

Yeah, look, yeah, I been broken
But look who I became, yeah, I been chosen
I manifested my dreams and I’m still goin'
I’m passin' up everybody from school that I’ve grown with
So when you diss, I’m convinced that you don’t know shit
You spend time at the bars, well I spend mine devoted
To my craft and skills, I double down and I hone them
Now I’m on the rise, and y’all look so hopeless

[Verse 2]
So despite my feelings of depression
Inside of my hell, lies a lesson
You can visualize your dreams and manifest them
Just realize that your mind is a weapon
And sometimes it can flip any second
It can make the strongest ones feel threatened
It can make the alive ones feel deaden
Point is your mind shapes you, if you let it
Started from the bottom, my dream was feelin' impossible
But now I’m at a level where I am feelin' unstoppable
The fruits of my labor and here and they taste phenomenal
Breakin' all of my records while breakin' through every obstacle
Coulda quit a long time ago, but that just isn’t in me
'Cause even when I am losin', I always feel like I'm winnin'
Whenever I hit the end, I’m excited for new beginnin's
Inspired by my potential, my drive's an ultimate feeling
I’m breakin' through every ceilin', my music is the new healin'
I used to hate saying goodbye, but now I am screaming good riddance
To anybody or critic, who doesn’t fit in my vision
I always remain persistent, found purpose in my existence
Don’t value people's opinions, I value moments I’m livin'
Was mentally in a prison, so breaking out was the mission
God really granted permission, and put me in this position
He’s guiding all my decisions, I’m feelin' high in my spirits, I’m
Preaching things that a pastor don’t preach
Teaching things that a teacher don’t teach
They really thought I would fall and sink
But I haven’t even hit my peak
And I won’t stop climbing until I reach
The summit, look down and all I see
Is those who doubted all underneath
What a view, ooh, that’s the view I need, I
Can manifest every single thing I imagine
I wouldn’t know this life if didn’t pursue my passion
I’m writin' this on a flight, while I’m starin' down at the planet
Realizin' that I’m alone, but this solitude had to happen
My friends were holding me back, I cut 'em off and I vanished
They didn’t wanna evolve, they were to content being stagnant
They were headed towards a dead end, I had foresight they were lacking
Now, I am living their dreams, they see me now and can’t stand it, I
Guess they didn’t believe
Envy in the air when they see me achieve
R.I.P. your goals, I’m watchin' all of you grieve
Money can't buy you levels that I’ve reached
But clown me, diss me, oh well
My success reminds you, you failed

I'll tear it all to bits

They said that I got sickness
But it's a smile, not a grimace
I'm in the comedy business

[Verse: Rustage]
Monsters, they be making stories 'bout these monsters
Look inside your heart, and see the demons that you foster
Play their roles so perfect like they working for an Oscar
Welcome to the circus - got a whole different roster
I don't play pretend 'cause I'm contracted with the devil's work
I'm not making cents, so I be asking what your Pennyworth?
We can't make amends without the risk of death or getting hurt
It's weird with all this hope they preach, they never gon' expect the worst
Watchin' 'em fall like they dominoes
Locking 'em up in a coffin, so that they can only respond to the knock-knock jokes
The way that I torture a body - his writing be looking like doctor's notes, I've literally got your nose
I send them to the other side like chickens crossing roads
They know that crime is a religion
You can lock me up in chains, but then your mind will be the prison
Know I'm writing, this is fiction, every line a new decision
When I'm all up in your house - I'll teach you why you keep your distance
Hand me the apron, I turn a man to a patient
Way that I step up with the six like it's the Landini Cadence
You feel the anticipation, it's such a happy occasion
So it's a shame that Barbara can't give me a standing ovation
I'm only mad on occasions, so put your plan on quotations
They tried to work out who I'll X like the quadratic equation
I drop bodies like GeoGuessr in a random location
I turn the choir into silence - that's a phantom arrangement
The way I never rest, starting up the piece like I'm a treble clef
Know I'm leaving blood up on your wedding dress, left for dead
Triple all my dubs like it's a web address
When I shake it up I'm wiping all your histories like it's an Etch-A-Sketch
Yuh, infecting waters, that's fishy business
Don't need a house of fun to see your mirror image
I be putting smiles on all these faces like they kids on Christmas
Little difference, I be breaking crowns - they know this prince is twisted
Ain't no God be saving you if he can't save the Queen
Cutting off your faces - I don't need no shaving cream
Madness is a medicine we use for pain relief
And I be leaving all your blocks red like piet when I paint the scene
Don't know why you hating me, these plots are not forgotten
I be dropping bars so much I make 'em look like Robin
If you wanted peace, then why the fuck you move to Gotham?
They all eat the apple when they knew the core was rotten
I be leaving Hoods riding Red 'cause they know my Brothers Grimm
All my bars go over your head like we in the jungle gym
Acting like a marionette, but without the puppet strings
Like a boy from Twickenham - the way I roll with Harley Quinn, ay

If they got it coming won't hesitate I'mma kill them
Long as I'm living, yeah
You can try stop me, it won't make a difference
I'm taking over Gotham City
I'll tear it all to bits
I'll do your makeup with your blood - it's not pretty
I'll crush this city, I want all of it

But it's a smile, not a grimace

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""

[Verse 3]
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

Feeling like a drop in the ocean
That don't nobody notice
Maybe it’s all just in your head
Feeling like you're trapped in your own skin
And now your body's frozen
Broken down, you’ve got nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're high on emotion
And you're losing your focus
And you feel too exhausted to pray
Don't get lost in the moment
Or give up when you're closest
All you need is somebody to say

[Chorus]
It's okay not to be okay
It's okay not to be okay
When you're down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay

[Verse 2]
Feeling like your life’s an illusion
And lately, you're secluded
Thinking you’ll never get your chancе
Feeling like you got no solution
It's only 'cause you're human

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

Tell me ""Go back home""

Feeling like a drop in the ocean
That don't nobody notice
Maybe it’s all just in your head
Feeling like you're trapped in your own skin
And now your body's frozen
Broken down, you’ve got nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're high on emotion
And you're losing your focus
And you feel too exhausted to pray
Don't get lost in the moment
Or give up when you're closest
All you need is somebody to say

[Chorus]
It's okay not to be okay
It's okay not to be okay
When you're down and you feel ashamed
It’s okay not to be okay

[Verse 2]
Feeling like your life’s an illusion
And lately, you're secluded
Thinking you’ll never get your chancе
Feeling like you got no solution
It's only 'cause you're human
No control, it’s out of your hands

Yo Aladdin, make sure my microphone is on
No wait a minute - hm-hm, now let me check my tone
(Before I start rockin') Yo, what we're callin' this homes?
(Ain't nothin goin on...) word
Well, if it ain't nothin but a funky song, I'm in it to win it
Properly fitted, so let's get with it
My lyrical format breaks and bends the rules
For those of you who wanna battle my crew
I come from the family down with Priority
Peace to N.W.A and Eazy-E
And to the homies everywhere that's down with Low Pro
Y'all want funk? Yo, yo, now here we go
Can I come on, or should I come off smooth and dope?
Spectacular, I make a amateur choke
You see, it's gotta be funky, doper than the average funk song
That's why I didn't come off strong
I chose a laid back jack and watched the others swoop and holler
They try to kick funk, but yo, why did they bother
This is pure funk, so y'all sing along
(Ain't nothin goin on but a funky song)

[Verse 2: W.C.]
Funk - the word for the day that I speak upon
It's like a drug, you could say that I'm sprung
Every time that I speak I pertain to a funky crowd
Turn up the radio, make sure that it's loud
The woofers are bumpin', the tweeders and tweetin'
The bass is kickin, Doub's about to start rippin'
All these MC's sound alike screamin' off of funky tracks
Got the nerve to put the garbage on wax
Artificial MC's, I break em with ease, they get dunked
They all lack the true meanin' of funk
A street hardcore sample with a positive tip
This here is so funky, all I need is a mothership
A pair of twelves and a mic in my hand, see
So I can get busy for those down with me
Have you yellin my name while I pertain to the brain
'Cause when it comes to funk, I'm leavin' permanent stains
So change arrange and yo, I ain't a new jack, gee
Aladdin gave me the mic, so I could speak my piece
Funk, the universal language, now can you swing it?
Some tried, but came softer than a Danish
Dunkenhein rappers is soft, they can't compete
Now here's a dope record tooken out of the backstreets
Y'all know the words, so yo, sing along
(Ain't nothin goin on but a funky song)

So now we come to the final verse of the song
I came to short-circuit, so go and clap along
Wave your hands in the air while you shout and go off
But keep away from the stage, because you might get tossed
Yo, now here's somethin that I know that you like
Somethin funky, but yet though, it's gotta be hype
So sing along, even though when I'm gone

Chill at your place but every day you would walk out
Uh, kept cool can we calm down, anger in flames, slapped in the face with your palm
I don't know what to do and it's late and I'm tired
And you're on my mind, take a hit to feel higher
Text you again when I'm feeling inspired
I've recognized I'm reigniting the fire
Ay, what you want to do with me
I heard you telling everybody that you cool with me
But like you never text back
Every night relapse on the pain but you never let your parents see that
Now you stuck in a cycle of fuck-ups and jealousy
In my livestream, hit me up just to yell at me
Wow, think of the times you were hesitant
Thoughts about me, hope you know they're indefinite

Damage and shattered to fragments

But I guess I suck and I just need some practice
And I'm wishing I could rip you out  my head like my hair
Yeah, If I was dead would you even care
If I had a funeral would you be there
Sometimes I wonder what colors you'd wear
Would you move on and tell yourself that you're strong
While you let me fade as I'm dead and I'm gone
Will you hold it down 'til you meet me and God
Or love someone else and leave me to be lost

I never saw through the lines
Growing up I thought that life would be fine
Now I'm just watching as everything dies

Children and women, yeah
If they got it coming won't hesitate I'mma kill them
Long as I'm living, yeah
You can try stop me, it won't make a difference
I'm taking over Gotham City
I'll tear it all to bits
I'll do your makeup with your blood - it's not pretty
I'll crush this city, I want all of it
They said that I got sickness
But it's a smile, not a grimace
I'm in the comedy business
I got God as my witness

[Verse: Rustage]
Monsters, they be making stories 'bout these monsters
Look inside your heart, and see the demons that you foster
Play their roles so perfect like they working for an Oscar
Welcome to the circus - got a whole different roster
I don't play pretend 'cause I'm contracted with the devil's work
I'm not making cents, so I be asking what your Pennyworth?
We can't make amends without the risk of death or getting hurt
It's weird with all this hope they preach, they never gon' expect the worst
Watchin' 'em fall like they dominoes
Locking 'em up in a coffin, so that they can only respond to the knock-knock jokes
The way that I torture a body - his writing be looking like doctor's notes, I've literally got your nose
I send them to the other side like chickens crossing roads
They know that crime is a religion
You can lock me up in chains, but then your mind will be the prison
Know I'm writing, this is fiction, every line a new decision
When I'm all up in your house - I'll teach you why you keep your distance
Hand me the apron, I turn a man to a patient
Way that I step up with the six like it's the Landini Cadence
You feel the anticipation, it's such a happy occasion
So it's a shame that Barbara can't give me a standing ovation
I'm only mad on occasions, so put your plan on quotations
They tried to work out who I'll X like the quadratic equation
I drop bodies like GeoGuessr in a random location
I turn the choir into silence - that's a phantom arrangement
The way I never rest, starting up the piece like I'm a treble clef
Know I'm leaving blood up on your wedding dress, left for dead
Triple all my dubs like it's a web address
When I shake it up I'm wiping all your histories like it's an Etch-A-Sketch
Yuh, infecting waters, that's fishy business
Don't need a house of fun to see your mirror image
I be putting smiles on all these faces like they kids on Christmas
Little difference, I be breaking crowns - they know this prince is twisted
Ain't no God be saving you if he can't save the Queen
Cutting off your faces - I don't need no shaving cream
Madness is a medicine we use for pain relief
And I be leaving all your blocks red like piet when I paint the scene
Don't know why you hating me, these plots are not forgotten
I be dropping bars so much I make 'em look like Robin
If you wanted peace, then why the fuck you move to Gotham?
They all eat the apple when they knew the core was rotten
I be leaving Hoods riding Red 'cause they know my Brothers Grimm
All my bars go over your head like we in the jungle gym
Acting like a marionette, but without the puppet strings
Like a boy from Twickenham - the way I roll with Harley Quinn, ay

You've been stuck in my head and girl I really wanna talk now
Chill at your place but every day you would walk out
Uh, kept cool can we calm down, anger in flames, slapped in the face with your palm
I don't know what to do and it's late and I'm tired
And you're on my mind, take a hit to feel higher
Text you again when I'm feeling inspired
I've recognized I'm reigniting the fire
Ay, what you want to do with me
I heard you telling everybody that you cool with me
But like you never text back
Every night relapse on the pain but you never let your parents see that
Now you stuck in a cycle of fuck-ups and jealousy
In my livestream, hit me up just to yell at me
Wow, think of the times you were hesitant
Thoughts about me, hope you know they're indefinite

For anybody that's wondering what my mind is
That shit's just solitary confinement
Open-minded, but my mind's been lost
And I'm really just trying to find it
Yeah we're magnets just trying to manage attraction
Damage and shattered to fragments
Love like a spiral I'm just trying to catch it
But I guess I suck and I just need some practice
And I'm wishing I could rip you out  my head like my hair
Yeah, If I was dead would you even care
If I had a funeral would you be there
Sometimes I wonder what colors you'd wear
Would you move on and tell yourself that you're strong
While you let me fade as I'm dead and I'm gone
Will you hold it down 'til you meet me and God
Or love someone else and leave me to be lost
I thought for life meant for life until momma remarried three times
I never saw through the lines
Growing up I thought that life would be fine
Now I'm just watching as everything dies

A message in the bottle
Smashed right across your head
All those years of screaming out
The words you never read
Sucking on a xenon tit
All hail the cretin king
Apprentice to an idiot
A sycophantic dream

And watch your freedom die...

You always compromised
You never put the effort in

You Want me to lose my cool? Do it look good on the news?
What is your angle? want me depending on you?
Putting my vision to rest, leading me on with a check?
Give me a noose, see if it fits my neck?
I can feel it, manipulate me into lookin crazy
The same thing they tried to pull with Jay-Z
I seen how they treated will smith in those interviews
Demonized, In the eyes of people that are tantalized so easy
Same thing they want to do with Yeezy, they say
In your prime of your life is where the devil lies
You can change the world, change a life
Change a culture for the better
Leave a legacy that stand the test of time
But a slap where we gotta draw the line damn

Grab ‘em quick, sell your dream, then flip, leave you stranded and dip
They put you out just as soon as you lit, just make sure you’re equip
You’re in the shadow of the puppetmaster
What do I need to give to you, what do you need from me
People to click into stations?
Am I your justification?
Is it the fact I’m desperate?
Need me to carry your message?
Need me to make you a profit?
Subliminally a target?
I can feel it, you just want to own me for your benefit
Percentages, percentages, the tools for your leverage
I signed away my freedom and you got it on the cameras
Should’ve read the fine print, id find that, I’ve always said
In the prime of your life is where the devil lies
Well I’ll be damned, why couldn’t I listen to my own advice

Will you take me back to when the woods were young?
(To when the woods were young)
When I fashioned a cauldron out of a hollow stump
(Out of a hollow stump)
Then I threw in a little of this
And I threw in a little of that
I managed to mumble some mumbo jumbo before I felt your cold dead hands

[Pre-Chorus]
And we were face to face
I never could forget that day
Her eyes were fires burning miles away
And her lips were so close I could have stolen a taste

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, drift off to sleep
You'll be one of us
Beneath my wing
Lost in a dream, kissing the succubus

[Post-Chorus]
I hope I never have to wake
I pray to her my soul to take
I beg death for eternal sleep

Timeless stones shape the walls of this site
Arcane and powerful symbols traced on them
May the moon lead my steps
In the sacred search of supreme knowledge
Waiting for his coming
And it was gloom

Somewhere in time
In unknown lands ruled by an ancient magic
In titanic forests
6 towers of power were built
They guarded 6 sacred heirlooms
Protected by 6 seals
They show the effigy of the god
Who sits on the big black throne

I mesmerize my soul
To fly along the dusty paths of
Acheron
Looking for the magic circle of the black ring

Tell me your secret

Or I will tear it from death to death

His strength glows if the hands
Invoking him are stained with blood
Where he shines, the blood is shed

There nature forces are shaken

Every day in the woods have cried
The words of vengeance and revenge
The Gods have watched him day and night
By the Northern stars bright light
Growing stronger. Coming nearer

Upon a steed as white as snow
He is riding through this land of no return
His hair blowing in the wind
A sword in his hand. And his eyes they burn

""Guide me, my Ravens. Find the way
Through the woods and snow

Let your eyes be mine seeking
For the valley of death
Come this far I am willing
To face the twin-headed beast's breath

Let your wings be my heart
In the air, black as the night
I have steel at side. Powers of thunder
The Gods with me ride

I trust on my Ravens , watching from above
Black as night. Swift as lightning
And graceful as the doves
You might also likeI trust on my Stallion. Born by the wind
Taking me through the valley
Where this world ends and the shadows begins

I trust on my Sword. Forged in fire and ice
Its sharp blade shall be baptised in blood
As I take the Beast's life

Cry, old crow, cry...

Come out of darkness, you beast of Hel, face me
Out on this field of moonlit snow
I will not be deterred by your ugliness
Before my sword your two heads will roll

I will not let my sword rest until its steel
Has sung for your ugly twin head
I'll wipe the sweat off my face with your bloody scalps
And watch your four eyes telling me that your dead.""

Gathering speed. Charging forward
Collision is close now
The swords are drawn, held high
They flash in the pale blue moonlight

Aiming at throats bare. The moment is so near
The time seems to halt for a while
Even the stars in the sky hold their breath
This is the moment of glory or death...

The moment to maim or be put to rest...

""So close now I almost can hear the black blood
In the beast's thick veins pumping
I am swinging my sword. May the Gods be with me

I ride out through the vast portals of Hel
I swing my sword in the air
And the dead beast's two bloody scalps attached
To a spear

Now is come the moment for me to set free
Those, along time ago, brought far north
By the twin-headed beast
On that daybreak when old crow did cry…

That hard winter when I still a child…

Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive
He bought his wife the finer things
And sent his kids to collage
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside
But thru it all he had one thing
That seemed to keep him going
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind
I watched his hair turn thin and gray
But his dream never faded
He told me all about it at least a thousand times
Chorus:
He always wanted, a place out in the country
Where the birds sing, in the morning
And the grass is emerald green
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine
And sit out in the evenin'
Where the air is, fresh and clean
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses
And more to get his son out of his run-ins with the law
The more it took the more he gave, never once complaining
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all
I never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city
And now he's got that special little place to call his own
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him
It wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone

She was all that I could see
She was all that was in front of me
Try to climb the mountain peaks
What if I only ever reach the sea?
Would you stay awake and wait for me?

Sit and wonder now if I'm doing fine
Hold me close and it'll be alright
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes

She was tired, I could see
Too late receiving love that slippеd from me
Tried to find the words to spеak
What if I only needed time to be?

Färger över frostig äng. Löv faller mot marken
Ett stormande hav av färger

Ett bidande mörker, står åter vid årets port... Landet faller
Mot en stilla dvala. Dunkla ter sig dagarna, under moln tyngda av
Regn. Isig är Rimfaxes fradga
I arla timma

Ropen från skogen kallar mig hem, till mina
Fränder... till min säng. Hemåt, hemåt... viskar mitt inre
Hem till djupa dalar och lövfyllda sänkor

Till stigarna jag alltid vandrat, till bäckar som släckt min törst
Till gölar och sjöar för mig så bekanta, där jag speglat mig, svalkat
Mig under stjärnklara nätter

Hem, för att känna morgonbrisens kyla
På rådarnas berg... hem

Tankar vandrar över gammal mark. Ekon av det
Gamla arvets hopp. Sluten av gudarnas tunga andedräkt

Askens blad viskar stilla, täljer om jorden och
Världar nedan, om bergen och de som där råda
Viskar om det som är mitt hem

Strömmar. Täljer om visdom som dväljs och

Viskar om havet och bäckarna som där mynnar

Fylld av minnen och gamla sår

Seg och kraftfull, stolt och klok. Med roten I myllan
Fylld av livets dryck

Täljer om de gamla folken, de vackra som dansar
Över myren. Om skogens konung som stilla vakar vid tjärnens
Kant

Om skogens härskarinna den fagra som förvillar
Detta kvinnliga väsen ljuvt doftande av löv

Den viskar om himlen och stjärnorna där ovan
Om hemligheterna som djäljes där. Viskar nordanbäckens friska
Vatten. Talar om Bifrost den slutliga vägen hem...

Stilla går solen ned I horisonten, de två världarna möts...
Ett drömmens rike faller inpå

Från tjärnen stiger en dimma, lätt som älvors tårar
Vandrar ovan den svarta ytan
Än en gång står jag här. På rådarnas berg
Känner nattbrisens kyla. Månen sjunger sin full

Hör mina fränder ropa. Välkomnar mig hem
Aldrig mer lämnar jag detta. Detta eviga bo

English translation:

The first dawn of autumn slowly rises
Spreading colour over frosty meadow
Leaves fall to the ground
A storming sea of colours

A biding darkness is yet again at Year's gate
The land sinks into a quiet torpor
The days appear dim under clouds heavy with rain
Icy is the froth of Rimfax in the early hours

The calls from the forest call me home. To my kin...
To my bed. Homeward, homeward my inner whispers
Home to deep valleys and leaf-filled vales

To the paths I've always wandered
To streams that have quenched my thirst
To ponds and lakes so known to me
Where I've watched my reflection
Cooled in the night under star-filled sky
Home, to feel the chill of the morning breeze on the mountain of the Fey...
Home

Thoughts wander over ancient land
Hope from the old legacy echoes
Shrouded in the heavy breath of gods

The leaves of the ash whisper quietly
They tell of earth and worlds below
Of mountains and those who rule there
They whisper of that which is my home

These roots that cool
In the cold streams of the underworld
They tell of wisdom that dwell
And the primal force glowing therein

They whisper of the sea
And the brooks flowing there
Of the forest brooding dark and still
Filled with memories and old wounds

Tenacious and powerful. Proud and wise
With the root in the soil. Filled with the liquid of life
They tell of the old people. The beautiful that dance over the bog
Of the king of the forest. Quietly watching by the shore of the lake

Of the mistress of the forest. The frail and misleading
This female being. With a delightful scent of leaves

They whisper of the sky and the stars above. Of the secrets above
They whisper of the fresh water in the northern brook
They tell of Bifrost and the final road home

The sun settles slowly in the horizon. The two worlds meet
A kingdom of dreams falls closely

From the lake a mist rises. Light, as the tears of elves
Wanders over the black surface

I stand here yet again. On the mountainof the fey
Feeling the cold of the night breeze. The moon sings its full

Hear my kin call. Welcoming me home
Never again will I leave this. My eternal homeEmbed",0,0,1

I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin' my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattoo tears

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)

We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? Huh? What?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinking made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinking caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin' tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattoed tears

Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Yo I been losin' sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowing now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin' and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talking to the heavens
Walking thru the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, starting with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nothing to lose, but my brain
I'mma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, crying these tattooed tears (haha)
Come on...

Literally trying everything possible to try to save what we have

Held you close so your hands don't freeze
Sweet talking, we would share all our thoughts
The first time that you met my Mom
Kept telling you to just stay calm

This is the shit I wrote
Woke up this morning with thoughts in my mind and I'm trying to keep control
Stressed out in life, it'll all be alright, I get money and get some more
Oh nothing will stop it, no
Gotta grind all the time even when it's cold
Gotta stay in the kitchen cold, when the heat is bold, and I'm staying throwed
Back at it again and again I zone
In that sense then I guess I'm a criminal
Hop into the Chevy it's sitting low
Loud pipes. when i hit it, it can really go
Drive fast, finna mash when I'm really though
Burn cash in the stash only i would know
Get gas and I'm back on the golden road, I'm on my own
No group ain't no damn friends
Ain't nobody wanna rap, didn't rap then
I've been wrapped in the craft like I'm trapped in
Getting faster I'm hazard, assassin
Feel the master I planned it out back then
Closed caskets on bastards who bashing
Dope, answer the fans if they asking
No chance ever quitting I'm blasting
No hands I'm irrational, Manson
Clashing, understand it's a ransom
Last thing that he thought's that I blast 'em
Rap game has a thing about chances
Raw talent, making moves and advancing
Not about better dudes who keep bragging
Anywho let me do what I'm asking
Either way I've been moving I'm past 'em

Haters wanting me to diss them back
Demons haunting me, a vicious pack
And I can't afford to bullshit this fact
You can't find me where am I at?
Down the road I had to get this sack
I won't record without that
In the zone I go I roll out these tracks
Hold up we say everyday
The life I live to bury this way
Enemies still hate me Pete's sake
Fuck 'em all they fall off, decay
It's easy, eas-ay
How my creed seems to get me paid

Spit with the harmony
Look at the art and see
Give it applause indeed
Begin to walk with me
To get the bark on trees
Get with the hard head chief
Walk in the park in peace

Go against me and with you I will wipe the floor
Drive to the hospital, ask the nurse, find the floor

And leave that spot where there was an IV Sore

But when you start the beef we'll
Head toward your guys
Metamorphosize and
Swarm like Beedrills

But kiddo, you're trying to be just like us?… Ditto

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Outro]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""2Embed",0,0,2

To the seat with the clearest view
As she walks to the silver screen

Composed in such a sick flow that I'll bury any MC on a radio or stage show

Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams

Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
Gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn and the train won't leave
Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean

[Verse 2]
Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
Gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn and the train won't leave
Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

[Chorus]
I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

[Verse 3]
Well, the way I feel is the way I write
Nothing like the thoughts of the man who lies
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes

Hey, kid—good morning—
You look like an angel
I don't remember when we fell asleep
We should get up, kid—
Cathy is waiting…

Look at us, lying here
Dreaming, pretending
I made a promise and I took a vow
I wrote a story
And we changed the ending—
Cathy, just look at me now!
Hold on, facts are facts—
Just relax, lay low
All right, the panic recedes
Nobody needs to know
Put on my armor—
I'm off to Ohio
Back into battle 'til I don't know when
Swearing to her that I
Never was with you
And praying I'll hold you again
You might also likeHold on, clip these wings—
Things get out of hand
All right, it's over, it's done—
No one will understand
No one will understand…

We build a treehouse
I keep it from shaking—
Little more glue every time that it breaks
Perfectly balanced
And then I start making
Conscious, deliberate mistakes
All that I ask for
Is one little corner—
One private room at the back of my heart
Tell her I found one
She sends out battalions
To claim it and blow it apart
I grip and she grips
And faster we're sliding
Sliding and spilling, and what can I do?
Come back to bed, kid—
Take me inside you—
I promise I won't lie to you
Hold on, don't cry yet—
I won't let you go
All right—the panic recedes
All right—everyone bleeds
All right—I get what I need
And nobody needs
To know
Nobody needs to know…
Since I have to be in love with someone
Since I need to be in love with someone
Maybe I could be in love with someone

Feel any remorse

No
I mean, I would if I could
But I can't
Cause, It wasn't no remorse for Latasha
It wasn't no remorse for Yusef Hawkins
And it wasn't no remorse when them muthafuckas kicked my ass
So, they can all muthafuckin' die
Til they respect me as a muthafuckin'  man
And every black man out there
They can all muthafuckin' die
And that's real
Until they do, more muthafuckas going to die
As long as they got bullets
It's going to be some justice around this muthafucka

Took an oath, put his soul in a hearse
To his people he brings so much hurt
No respect when he comes into work

Just a token nigga to all your peers
All day you bringing your people to tears
Just to brag about 15,000 man years?

Planted by a crooked ass cop
Call them Po lice, they get annoyed as fuck

On the porch with bangers with torches, ain't gotta dab rig
Doing the most is what I could do at least
Moving like I decided not to renew a lease
Picture me rolling view at laguna beach
Puffing a Cuban, giving someone the Big Kahuna speech
Holding my crotch 'cause of how hard it was
Hood that we was in, none of us had a car garage
And a mirage, did not realize it was sabotage

Last- Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you
There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again

What should I do? (Eat lunch)
What should I do? (Eat dinner)

And came back to find you were gone
I spent a week in Illinois
And came back to find you were still gone
I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends

You were all looking around
And I hoped it was for me
I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me
The ancients saw it coming
You can see that they tried to warn them
In the tales that they told their children
But they fell out of their heads in the morning
They said sex can be frightening
But the children were not listening
And the children cut out everything
Except for the kissing and the singing
When they finally found their homes
At Walt Disney studios
And then everyone grew up
With their fundamental schemas fucked, but, but
But there are lots of fish left in the sea
There are lots of fish in business suits

I've seen dark before, but not like this
This is cold, this is empty, this is numb
The life I knew is over, the lights are out
Hello, darkness, I'm ready to succumb

[Verse 2]
I follow you around, I always have
But you've gone to a place I cannot find
This grief has a gravity, it pulls me down
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind
""You are lost, hope is gone
But you must go on
And do the next right thing""

[Verse 3]
Can there be a day beyond this night?
I don't know anymore what is true
I can't find my direction, I'm all alone
The only star that guided me was you
How to rise from the floor
When it's not you I'm rising for?
Just do the next right thing
Take a step, step again
It is all that I can to do
The next right thing

I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath
This next step
This next choice is one that I can make

[Verse 4]
So I'll walk through this night
Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And with the dawn, what comes then
When it's clear that everything will never be the same again?
Then I'll make the choice
To hear that voice
And do the next right thing3Embed",0,0,0

I fucking love beginnings
Flying high!
It's hard to know where to start
It's all so fast
I'm trying not to spin
I guess I'm older
And it's harder when you're older to begin
Peeling plaster
Sagging roof
Two missing stairs
A buckled wall
I'm fired up to do this
But on my own it all…

So much damage
Broken windows
Pipes are shit
Crap veneer
It's hours later
Jesus, I'm still standing here
Still standing here

But when the sunlight hits the parlor wall
At certain times of day
I see how fine this house could be
I see it so damn clear!

Verse 1

(Mayklens Don)
She want a gentlemen
I’m mostly a bad guy
My pride don’t allow me to let things slide

Pardon if I check this sucka baby
While we’re on this date Ma’
He’s selling tickets
That’s just things that I don’t buy

Now back to the schedule
I’m past talking
What we can do all sexual?
Will you be quiet  in the room
When they throw numbers to pressure
That just lies that they telling you
This be the life that I get into
I can see that you’re ready too

(Elae Weekes)
I been thinking bout you and me
I heard a little something bout the Birds and the Bees
Think Of the skies and what of the seas
What’s in my heart that's making me week?
I just wanna be clear

And where are we going from here?
We could move forward or sit and be still
Stop planning tomorrow let's live for today
We heard about work but don't forget about play
I just want to be clear

If you get the chance then come my way
We could start a future but let's start today
We could get lost in the ocean waves
Let’s sail away to sunny days

I've been holding back these feelings for a while
Gazing in the stars
Tryna find your mile
We can talk about what makes you tick, I have all day
Take your time

(Break down)


(Mayklens Don)
You're not safe with your new lover
It's a role they play to get under covers
Please can you be safe stay out of trouble

Never let you go, I see in the dark, more deadly than sharks

No matter the matter I'll still do it, you won't see it coming I bet

You're an angel, I'm a mess
Darling, I've got nothing left
The skin I wore when we first met
Surely has by now been shed
And I'll paper over what I lack
I'll fill in the pores and cracks
I hope whatever you were running from
Didn't catch you when you thought that you were gone
And I crossed another border
Further from home for the third time this week
And I wish I had the intelligence or identification to buy a phone
I'd give anything to hear you speak
Say something sweet
Say something nice to me

Like when we held hands in the front seat of the car
When we fucked in New Year's Park
Thought that I would feel whole, thought that I would feel free
Least you thought I had a soul, least you fucking noticed me
This morning I'll walk north on Main Street
Towards the temples, feel the sun's heat
And I'll know whatever happens, my conscience will be clear
Even if I let these thoughts I have puff up in smoke and disappear

Feel any remorse
For the cops that got killed?

No
I mean, I would if I could
But I can't
Cause, It wasn't no remorse for Latasha
It wasn't no remorse for Yusef Hawkins
And it wasn't no remorse when them muthafuckas kicked my ass
So, they can all muthafuckin' die
Til they respect me as a muthafuckin'  man
And every black man out there
They can all muthafuckin' die
And that's real
Until they do, more muthafuckas going to die
As long as they got bullets
It's going to be some justice around this muthafucka

To them, I look suspicious
They glance at each other and they start to grin
Decide to get behind me right then
Turn on they Uncle Sam lights

Check my speed, I’m good
Black guy, white hood
Stomach meets, to chest
Are those tickets still on my desk?
Comes to my window, I let it down 2 inches
He says, can you let it down some more
I looked that muthafucka right in his eyes and said
What the fuck did you pull me over for
Somebody called, we got a complaint
No turn signal when you switched lanes
Uh, What’s your girlfriend’s name?
Would it happen to be Mary Jane?
Racist ass cops, all niggas don’t smoke
Ya’ll always wanna crack them corny ass jokes
I got aggressive, when I threw him my Progressive
Hurry this shit up, so I can get home

What’s the motivation in the beginning
To make 45k
Then blow it all at Binion’s
You must’ve got picked on you fuckin nerd
Payback disguised as “protect and serve”
Getting stuffed in lockers by D’Angelo Bailey
Too dumb for college, rejected by the military
Black cop, that nigga’s the worst
Took an oath, put his soul in a hearse
To his people he brings so much hurt
No respect when he comes into work
Fucked up Haircut, gotta shave your beard
Just a token nigga to all your peers
All day you bringing your people to tears
Just to brag about 15,000 man years?
Yall fuck with people for no reason

I ain’t afraid to admit
I ain’t sad when a cop gets hit
Ya’ll think that makes me bad
Shid, I ain’t the only one who feels like that

How many wives filed for divorce
How many little girls became pole dancing whores
Cause on a traffic stop
In Daddy’s drop top
They said they found some rocks
Planted by a crooked ass cop
Call them Po lice, they get annoyed as fuck
Lice to the Poor, little annoying fucks
Nigga get money, Ya’ll wanna target his black
Literally, can’t wait to shoot his ass

Yet, We grew up totally different

[Verse]

I lit a couple matches
Crushed below my foot
It burned to my attic
Now it’s raining soot
I keep on
Keep feeling close to you
I keep on
The sand on my feet feels so new
Whisper from the shoreline
Laid my ear down hard
Shells hear ocean
My cell ain’t turning on
I keep on
Keep on holding on to
I keep on
The water matches you


[Chorus (behind second chorus)](x2)

I don’t
I don’t
Wanna feel
I don’t
I don’t wash my body in the sea
[What waves can't tell me]
(I can’t be alone
Walking in the shore
I’m searching for
What waves can’t tell me
The waves can’t tell me)

I don’t like the beach no more
I don’t like the surf or the sand
It hurts my hands to let it run through
Look at the edge I’ve come to
Never wore sunscreen
Even when you’d watch me
Waves felt like homestead
Always run into the ocean
I can’t drown no more
That’s not what these blues were meant for
I can’t swim to shore
The tide pulled me out I’m sure
I lit a couple matches
Crushed within my teeth
High tide don’t panic
The water only seems too deep

[Chorus]

I don’t wash my body in the sea
I don’t want the shore to carry me
I don’t wanna go outside just to see
I don’t know why you didn’t wait for me
[Behind Chorus and voicemail]

You call out my name
Swim left
The shore seems far away
I’m swept
Under the waves
I won’t forget
The time we spent
Not much time left
You called sorry
I can’t pickup
Fall came early
Summer missed her
But golden rays
Hit ocean deep
At night the waves
Don’t let me sleep

[Voicemail]

The wind gets the ashes
My tongues tied to matches
My lungs get the ashes
You asked the water carry your ashes
But I didn’t get it when I was young
I didn’t get the feeling
I didn’t get the feeling
I didn’t get the freedom
I didn’t get how you could ask me to do that
But I let you free
Never seeming to let you go
I hope the water keeps you close to me
I hope the waves bring you to the shore when I’m there at night when I can’t sleep
Or when I’m sleeping and I find myself walking the shore during the day
I didn’t get how you could let me go
But I let go with my hands in the water
I let go with my hands in the water
And that’s when I called
Like I said some are just ideas
I really miss her ma
I really can’t let her go
Anyways
Call me back when you get this message
Alright love you

Wrote this on a bus you can say that its my travel flow
Movies while we moving you can say that its a travel show
Shopping out in Brooklyn and some places that you'll never go
Online we watching TV cuz at home we ain't got cable so
Spend our money differently, focused on these accessories
A pin that's for my hat little bracelets a necessity
Cooking up the recipe, I'm trynna find my own style
Something like if Goldsmith met James Dean met Charles Brown
Classy and a bad ass little dirty playing grab ass
With my girl we out in public, but we'll save it till we get back
Telling me to stop, I was born for this quit fronting
Me and Kanye share a birthday you can't tell me that means nothing
Stuck using that Garageband, I know that that's a downgrade
Trynna make this music shit so hopefully I'll get paid
Hopefully I'll get laid, wait that already happened
Man that fuckin' happened way before I started rappin'
Man I'm so stylish I ain't even got a stylist
I take a look around and I see who looks the flyset
Then I take another look and I decide who's looking classy
Then I bring it all together now tell me what you call that shit

This is me home you know I'm all about it
Prolly waking in the morning putting on a fresh outfit
Skating round town levis and a button up
Snapback or strapback, you see me homies yo whats up

They think he's lost on some horizon

Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love, till eternity

And when I stay up late he's always waiting
But I feel him hesitate

And honesty’s not a preferred reply
Tip-toe’ing you-know applies the same weight
We’re grinning before
Our novocaine

I’m packing my bag for another red-eye
Rewriting my story with auto-reply
The voice in my head just spitting out pain
Thought I was in my bed, but I’m still on the train

If life is a road
The meaning is gold
Like the rivers that run
It’s here and it’s gone
We travel alone
And call it our home
Destination unknown
Disconnect on our own
A bridge over a broken river runs dry
The sleeping dogs woken
A dead-end road sign
And nothing is so old to hide from today
What else fills the gap?
Left from words you don’t say
Nobody cares what you never had said
“No rest for the wicked” or “Rest when your dead”?
Born blessed with a ticket
A mirror in your head
You can’t erase, erase engraved lead

Stained glass on the window
Wrapped in the ragged soul of an old gentle hymn
Making deals with the clouds
Dreaming of those final hours
When the thunder proudly bows to all whispering things

But old ways how they fly
Like the earth from a tired eye
Born again in a new life of flickering whims
We met at those crossroads
Where losing's the only way to go
You looked at me as if to say
""Won't you show me another way, and...""

Take me to your hiding place
Just a soul without a map that got lost 'long the way
Worlds carved in stone, now somehow erased
Souls without maps yet bound to fly away

We kissed in the falling leaves
Sang old time melodies
Danced as our shifting feet turned stumbling
We built our towers tall
Near a sea of shared tears fallen
And cursed the waves that eat the walls ever crumbling

Find their way through fixed years
On into the circling spheres so far above us
Honey, are you the one to fall
Together with me through it all?

That you're the one that can light my way, and...

Take me to your hiding place
Just a soul without a map that got lost 'long the way
Worlds carved in stone, now somehow erased
Souls without maps yet bound to fly away

Stones in the river thrown
Shimmering, sinking alone
Won't know how far flows their rippling rings
So the words of a man grow
Washing over every soul

Blue lights flashing, they got traffic stopped
And Highway 11's done turned into a permanent road block
I wasn't driving, my wife was my D.D.
And she hadn't drank a drop, still got hassled by the J.P.D
And I said hey dude can't you just leave her alone
She ain't done nothin' wrong man and we just wanna go home
Woah-woah

[Chorus]
And I was mad as hell, thinking fuck the po-po
And they wonder why folks don't trust 'em no more
Woah-hoah
And I'm not gonna let this go, and I'm singing fuck the po-po
Fuck the po-po

[Verse 2]
So I got arrested, just for speaking up
And that cop said boy the only right you have is to shut the fuck up
Now I'm a jail-bird, I've done time in the pen
And I've got a real messed up story to tell all my friends
Yeah, my name was in the newspaper in my home town
They ruined my reputation because I didn't bow down
Hell no

[Chorus]
And now I'm mad as hell singing fuck the po-po
And they wonder why folks don't trust 'em no more
Woah-hoah
And I'm not gonna let this go and I'm singing fuck the po-po

Two fingers in the air for the J.P.D
The long-arm of the law coming down on me
Now I understand why all these rappers are mad
They must have been treated as badly as I have
Now I'm screaming thug life, fuck the po-po
Shootin' birds out the window whenever the cops go by
They're puttin road blocks in front of my house man
Man I'm starting to feel like I live under the Taliban
Can't drive home without a gun in my face
Thursday through Sunday, they're invading my space
Tellin' me its for my sake, they're keepin' the streets safe
By gettin' all the drunks off of the highway
But I say man, that's a big fuckin' lie
It's all about the money from the D.U.I.'s
Otherwise they'd be parked out in front of this bar
Giving free breathalyzers before we get in our cars
Instead they just hide about 3 miles away
And sit and wait for one of us to make a mistake
Drink a little too much and you'll be cuffed and stuffed
And probably roughed up if you complain enough
You'll be carted off to jail, in the land of the free
Another victim of the over-zealous J.P.D
Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean disrespect
There’s a lot of good cops, who serve and protect
And they boldly put their lives on the line
To protect our rights and give us peace of mind
But for every cop who thinks his badge is a crown
This song is for you, and I'll never bow down

And I'm mad as hell singing fuck the po-po

And gets the front door
It's the college boy from up the street
Here to cut the grass while her husband's away
And the neighbors they peaked through the blinds
'Cause they know her man's overseas, lost in the war
She fixes her hair up, lets the boy inside

When I was told I'll be battling one of my idols
I wondered if beating her was worth the title
When they told me who, I said, ""Wait, beg your pardon?
Shania Twain? No problem, I thought you meant Dolly Parton""
Your latest album's called Now, and I get the visions
If you called it 15 Years Ago, people may have listened
You took a decade off, let me help a touch
Tonight on this stage, you don't impress me much

[Round 1: Shania Twain]
You expected Dolly Parton? Must be hard on you
'Cause when I heard ""Meghan Trainor"", my response was, ""Who?""
I'm busy selling records, fuckin' right
You're a Target back-to-school ad come to life
Yeah, I took some years off, I admit that's true
I only did it to make room for new artists like you
But Meghan, I'm happy now to put you in your place
You don't want treble tonight, because I'm all about that bass

[Round 2: Meghan Trainor]
See, now, you a cowgirl from Canada who likes to get loose
When you home on that farm, what you ride, a moose?
You're called the North's best, but they be dead wrong
I guess they never heard a Celine Dion song
My career just started, I barely begun
When it comes to elevator music, you're still the one
You had a million hits, nobody could contain ya
From this moment on, bow down to Meghan Trainor

After hearing your new song, I wish it was my hearing
I sold a hundred million albums in my career
But I'm super proud of you, Meghan, you've had a couple fun years

[Round 3: Meghan Trainor]
Shania is famous for her awful stage fright
I'm the only thing on stage that can scare you tonight
You sold a lot of records, yeah, I'll give you that, fine
But who's a fan of your music? Not any man of mine
Now I'm doing things that I knew you couldn't
When I take home that trophy, man, I'll feel like a woman
I wrote these mean raps 'cause they forced me to
The truth is, my whole life, I've been obsessed with you

[Round 3: Shania Twain]
Your compliments are really top-shelf
It's cute you're obsessed like everyone else
Your anger comes from jealousy, it's plain as can be
You'll never have a career as long as me
Of course you like my music, that's obviously true
'Cause if there was no Shania, there'd be no you
And I know we're battling to see who's meaner

How can I
Hit rewind
So I could find
A single reason why
You would leave
With no goodbye
No apology
Our future left behind

[Chorus: Alan Benjamin Thomas]
Three years of my life just gone
And I can't seem to find the moment
You realized I'm not the one
And walked right out the doorway
We were good until we weren't
Now I'm facedown in our apartment
Wondering why you'd ever wanna leave me brokenhearted

Was life with you
Did someone new
Comе and change your mind?

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And, darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

We can make it if we try

Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us
You and I

When the sun widens its eyes
I no longer know what's goin' on in here

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Ayy, ayy
Wakin' up soon, but I wanna sleep
Nothing is worse than leavin' these sheets
Barely awake, still brushing my teeth
Running the tap, rinse and repeat
You were the lady and I was a tramp
But showing you off, I felt like the champ
I was your favorite, but fading away
Leaving saliva all over my face
Movies on Fridays no longer a thing
Huh, I-I feel it sting
What didn't I bring? 'Cause I brought a lot
In case you come back, I'll be saving your spot
Try making a difference and showing you life
Stuck at your side, you stuck in a knife
Pourin' you wine, you pourin' my blood
Wipe out my lifе, in need of a flood, yeah

[Chorus: Powfu]
I need a flood, I need an ending
I'm scared of thе truth, so I'll keep pretending
Don't need a reason, I've been defeated

Some people look for you, some look for an exit
Might hurt you, might hate it, but never regret it

How could I ever hate what had shaped me?
Been to hell, how could death ever phase me?
Wish 'em well, even when they all hate me
Let me be, take my soul and finally set it free
Spread my ashes on the seven seas
Let me rest in peace, when I'm dead, deceased

I threw this Halloween party
And I invited forty of my best friends
Cate and Tommy showed up
I got them a drink, said, ""How was your weekend?""
That's when I first heard your name
And saying it tastes like violets, rum and summer
Cate had had family stay from Canada
""Maisie, did you meet my brother?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And then I said, ""No, I didn't""
And then he started coming over
And my heart went
""Love him, he's the one and we shall wed""
And then my head said

[Chorus]
""Are you gonna work, you gonna hurt
You gonna last forever?""
""Are we gonna make it, gonna break it
When it's now or never?""
""If it's gonna hurt, will it be worth it?
And will I recover?""
""Are you gonna feel the way I feel?""

Likes cheap cigars and can shotgun a beer like no other
Grabbed his hand in the dark and I pull him to the car
And the speakers play Nirvana

And now I'm opening the front door

We tripped and fell into my bed

When I was young and stupid, my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me, ""Please, don't worry""
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches

[Verse 2]
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus]
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
I know you don't, but I—
I know you don't, but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone, but I—
That girl is gone, but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit, but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb

If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up

You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms, tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams, it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand
[Verse 3]
You don't have no money? He'll get you some
You don't have no car? He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy 'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio and the Bowery and the slums
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head, on the TV screen
Hey buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand

Ill do all the things to show
How a good man understands
Cause right now I'm lonely lonely

I'm back, nigga, wassup? ""Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the Devil, is it true?"" Nigga, shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love, so if you get bashed then that's tough luck
FV doin' shit so big, haters, I'm on your side now, nigga, fuck us! It's Knock Madness
Yeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga but I rap with vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack can fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect
I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me dome
They all yellin', ""Hopsin, you turn me on""
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me, woah
And I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me home
Nigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)
See, I got a crew (Crew), but I feel solo
I cruise (Cruise), but the wheels don't roll (Woah)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Uh?) Shit, neither do I (Nah)
I'mma give you niggas one more album then after that
It's peace out, man, I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?

[Verse 2]
Hopsin is doomed, locked in a room, spaced out like a little pop of the shrooms
God lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news? I made a million bucks but did not get abused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should've never went and dropped outta school
""It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!""
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror (Shit! Fuck! Fuck!)
I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go to pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like ""Ugh...""
I put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby-Doo (-By Doo)
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't kill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man, I don't even know who I are no more

I feel like I lost myself

[Verse 3]
Man, y'all niggas tryin' to kill my vibe, lately don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy blowin' up, tryin' to steal my shine, I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But, ""Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'! The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that, I'll buy!""
Well, I got news for you, my screws are loose, I'll tell ya
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to Australia
When I go ghost, I'mma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' ""YOLO"" on a couch, feelin' so dope
Livin' low pro so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like ""Hell yeah""
Man, I'm losin' my mind! But y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cares so I use the beats
To talk to so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?
[Chorus]
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If ya got a solution for me you should probably

Check me out right here ya'll

Verse One: Diddy
Yo, the sun don't shine forever
(BIG: You can turn the track up a little bit for me)
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
(BIG: All up in my ears)
Better now than never, business before pleasure
(BIG: The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud)
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
(BIG: YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin
(BIG: YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up)
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin?
(BIG: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
(BIG: Music's gettin louder)
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
(BIG: This shit is hot!)
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked
(BIG: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke

And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a wing cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up plats

In a Commision, dont ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of ... (Satan) ... they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under the vest by the abdominal
Hum a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White
Chorus: Busta Rhymes
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
(repeat all 2X)

Verse Three: Diddy
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
Been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be
Verse Four: The Notorious B.I.G
We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggas step up, we just macin them
Placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission

Chorus w/ Diddy talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out
There?
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody

Why do we play with fire?
Why do we run our finger through the flame?
Why do we leave our hand on the stove
Although we know we're in for some pain?

Oh, why do we refuse to hang a light
When the streets are dangerous?
Why does it take an accident
Before the truth gets through to us?

Cages or wings?
Which do you prefer?
Ask the birds
Fear or love, baby?
Don't say the answer
Actions speak louder than words

Why should we try to be our best
When we can just get by and still gain?
Why do we nod our heads

Wondering if I should follow
You had to go
And, of course, it's always fine
I probably could catch up with you tomorrow

To be growing apart?
When did I become the one
Who's always chasing your heart?

I am lost in the woods
North is south, right is left
When you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

The next step was a question of how
I never thought it was a question of whether
Who am I, if I'm not your guy?
Where am I, if we're not together

She never knew the reason why

And we've been dutifully paying our dues and paying heed to our advisors

How fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips

So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac

Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west

Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
Who'd give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal...metal!

In life, I have no religion
Besides the heavy metal gods
Wear nothing but black skin tight leather
My skin's clad with metal studs
Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
I give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal...metal!
In the book of heavy metal

Some twenty years ago, the goods put down their feet
So firmly in to the ground that no man of sword nor pen
Could ever change the rules upon which
The very fundament of metal was made

Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
Read all about it, in the manual
Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
Read all about it, yes, read it!

Why did I sip that potion
I'm so done with holy ghosting

Lay me down up in the ocean
Until you see no motion
Right now I can barely focus
I'm showing no emotion
On your knees show your devotion
My skin is black but golden
I'm not here for bragging boasting
Ain't lying I been chosen
Mind is burning, hearts exploding
This is my magnum opus

Reading murder books, trying to stay hip

(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)

She sip that lean, get high as the Eiffel Tower
Then salute my dick, call it General Eisenhower
Man, A-Ks all in that pussy
Glocks inside that punanai
Leave the window open and the fuckin’ door cracked
Nigga come and find me

[Verse 2 - Los]
Somebody told me a nobody told him something about me
Bout something about me, but nobody know nothing about me
That’s something about me you should know
To use a flow such as mine
You’s a pro, losers know
But I don’t know you losers though
Battle me you’ll lose your dough
You’ll have to use tubes through your nose
And count the views from your YouTube to blow
Blow a dick and pick a flower

Yeah I think I’m fly to death
Silence best describes what I do to all these rap niggas
If you wack niggas

Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour

Piss me off, I’ll kill this world in one hour
Give your girl back shots and shoot em back to you in an hour
Move forward from the bullshit
Gotta take a ride in a hearse
‘Cause settin’ clocks back the only way I was reversed
When I say I was reversed
You thinkin’ I was in time
I’m thinkin’ hours is
Everything that’s ours is fine
Man, them hours was flyin’
Man I was just fine
Damn, you soft as collagen
All you cowards is dyin’
Man, acknowledge this
Hoes giving me knowledge is fine
I’m talking knowledge like they really got college in mind
I drop knowledge like my mind got a college in mind
And I’mma school you, I already got a college in mind
Nigga polish your grind
When your grind polished you shine
This is large quantities of high quality grind
It’s all policy

Set the time for the battleground
Guided missiles will hunt you down
Drones surround your homes
Don't breathe, you're not safe underground
Political landscape shape has been polarized
Now it's time to reveal the zeal
Everybody breathe, get mobilized
Radiation beams out your screens
It's like a poltergeist
Trying to buy the American dream
But it's overpriced
5 bill deal for thе fighter jets
Bein' shippеd to the Middle East
It'll cost 10 billion more dollars for neighbors to feel safe to breathe

The shadow is bound to the tree

You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out

I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right

Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)

New Jack, New Jack..........

Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid
My education's low but I got long dough
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!

Natty Dread like Bob, so rock steady
With no spaghetti with meat sauce
Maybe salads with one toss
No bread of the sorrow 'cause afraid to see tomorrow
It's religion, never suspicious
But too delicious for the tongue
See, the lungs breathe the natural high
Just like the shirts that's so lovely
So ask Marco Polo and I never go solo
Because I roll with the crew that keep the funk flows
That make ya dance until the sisters take glance
I hope you find romance... try your luck, take a chance
'Til I enter, like the Milton Plaza, I'm the center
Of it all, the fuckin' prince of the ball
Standin' six-feet tall, that's a long way to fall
But not worried 'cause my vision ain't blurry
The I's hotter than the spice and curry
So don't stress the Father, or you might feel the fury

[Verse 2: Grap Luva]
So check the situation, a raw deal is what we're facin'
Bust the flavors of the rules they mandatin'
The climate gets hotter as the city gets smaller, more squalors
A million and one cats, they tryin' to earn top dollar
Half that mill, they straight out to kill
Uncultivated and destined to act real ill
Black let up in the things of five boroughs of pain
Only reason why the East and the West it ain't the same
I'm twenty-somethin' years of age
And life surely ain't about hand-outs, so I lays my plan out
Hard work is levicated to an art called survival
Consider Jah's lesson from conception to arrival
Now that I'm here, my fears shall decrease
Learnin' about life, makin' my way to the East
From four-square yard struggler, the G's on time
Yo, God, hit me with that rhyme

Now, in '95 to 2000, Rob is on some next shit, game tight
Yeah, in your heart, you know it ain't right
Ascension among the ranks
I'm givin' thanks to the Most High for plantin' me firm

There was a time
You and I get faded together
On the floor, so high
And I stayed there forever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You took the high road, I took the bottle
A little taste of freedom
But I get the feeling that I'll be needing
Somebody I can lean on

[Chorus]
When I'm drunk and out on my own
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home?
When I'm down at the end of my rope
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home?

[Refrain 1]
Home, home, home
When I'm down at the end of my rope
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home?

In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetus is falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no, not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50, we will never get caught by the cops

You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic, so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn-burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn-learn
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn-turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many-many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

Wolfgang couldn’t see the future
And nor can you
Who would’ve thought
The best rapper would hate Pro Tools
Who would’ve thought
The best rapper would lack vocals
Who would’ve thought
The best rapper don’t keep a tommy tucked
Who would’ve thought
The best rapper don’t like tummy tucks
I like my women real as lunch
No additives added all natural
And they like it rough
Who would’ve thought
He started this Romulus shit
But the city act like
They forgot who I was
Y’all got me twisted
Like a pack of halls
It’s cold out
So watch me deck the halls
Like the principal just called
That was a joke
Don’t get my homie involved
He got me back in school
When I got kicked out like a jaw
My only weakness
Weak in the knees
That’s a kick to the balls
Is the fact that I’m emotional dog
I wear my heart on my sleeve
And all I wear polo Lacoste
Just kidding
I’m not an idiot
All my polos pink
Like Ye’s
Before the industry
I drop beef
Like a Indian
I got change to spare
Like Obama meeting with 50 Cent
Man I’m fucking ignorant
Now I know you listening
Who would’ve thought I
Almost killed myself
Tryna help everybody else
Don’t even say
I’m talking about Wayne
Man that’s the road I live on
It points back to me
Not the track actually
I’m talking bout SOV
It’s funny
Romulus was a king
And that’s what my name mean
Like I said it’s fate
It all points back to me
I’ll lead you to the moon
Don’t turn your back to me
I control the new school
Who you think
Fund the faculty
My first album
Was worth 2 Ls
So I came back
Hard as he
Hard as who
Hard as Me
Hard to believe
This the same dude
Who passed out mixtapes
Almost a day late
Because I bought DVDs
And that’s super serious
Someone said
Tahj dissed the kid
And now the best rapper furious
I didn’t diss back
It wasn’t worth my time
Talked to him
A year later
That diss was a lie
Think about that
Someone pitting
Two Gods against each other
What are the odds
I’d say mighty large
Pun intended
In fact I got a pun to mention
What do you get
When SoV splits his heart
On track
For you to listen
Long division
Daniel said
He admires my ambition
What the hell would he think
If I told him
I thought about quitting
I let him down
I can’t finish my ‘sentence’
And ain’t no period needed
Since the subject is missing
The only class
I had a A in was English
9th grade was a train wreck
A plane crash
Foreshadowing the end
With the beginning of my days damn
That’s irrelevant though
We gotta go back
Before we go forward
Rome wasn’t built in a day
It was built in four
I look forward to the day
I talk my shit in the filmore
Am I going too fast
I forgot to yell fore
Keep yo nose out my business

And I spend it on girls and shoes

The thought of killing entered my mind
Some time ago
What possesses an individual to kill
I have often pondered the thought
Time and time again
Now it's clear to me

[Verse 2]
They want me to be part
Of this world they have created
I say fuck you
Don't tell me how to live

[Verse 3]
Maybe if I eliminate the people
Who fit this so called mold
My pain will finally be released
And my mind free of thought

[Verse 4]
The ax struck hard and fast
Splitting the skull in two
She fell instantly
The blood spewed
From where her head used to be
I then struck another blow

From these two blows

Collectively ain’t past this plastic awkward phase
Such malaise mongst masses
Delayed reactions
Drastic tactics
Felt off axis …backbone fractured from the weight of it
Samples captured at 12 bits
Rechopped now it’s lit
Exist to reinvent …Voice my discontent …Disconnect from the nascent
Survived with the craziest
Odd coined the 48 Radius
Love my compatriots
And won’t compromise
Content polarized
For all it implies
Doctrines defied directly
Defined correctly …both as a poet and MC
Potent intensity
Words worth mentioning
Living in the Age of Uncertainty
Absence of clarity creates opportunity
Disrupt continuity!

Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?

Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

No dilution to the norm
Put to the test...
Walking with the blind
Bleed the disease
To exterminate man
Unsound knowledge
For the less grateful
Seedling sprouting-
Up into spoiled plotting
Harsh on the plagued...

Drown... broken down
Symbol of man's sterility
In a broken glass
Shattered are the weak
Like slivers of glass
Slowly penetrating flesh

Sin bleeds its stain through ages
Violence eats its own

In enormous hordes

Continue this phase

Reveal the sterile mind

An overpopulation of fools
Teach the broken this soul escape
Reach the deeply shattered
The spreading colonies...
Withholding its rapture
The escape to infiltrate
The plagued sky opens
Its eyes of redemption
Shedding its tears
The wings of hope...
Singed and burned
Too many times praising
The hands of murder
The vision of a man's dream diseased
Steer yourself clear...
Promise not to interfere
A rising downfall... drunk and raped

Hiding the light
For a breath of slow growth
Warmth bearing the birth of death
A winter of pain for the delight
To belie the truth of man...
This unbalanced offset

Raped by intoxication

Inject a sterile thought
With an infection
Now the ladder to regression
So... lost... divine
Deprived of the innocent
Producing potential

A distressed form of fingerpainting

Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
""You stand accused of robbery"" - he heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains, and the seas

But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum

He spent his final night of freedom

I don't feel like I'm pretty
Do I have the same glow about me
As that night in the city?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you told me I remind you of the moon
I'm still holding onto that and onto you

[Chorus]
When you look at me, do you still think
That I shine brighter than anyone?
Or have you seen somebody else lately
Who reminds you of the sun?

[Verse 2]
I've been hoping since late September
That you'd act how you used to
You keep saying you don't remember
Hate that I have to tell you

Christmas got colder without you
I know that it’s sad, but it’s true
Now I’m watching the snow fall, waiting for a phone call
But I know that it won’t be from you
And the sleigh bells got softer without you
They don’t carry quite the same tune
And as I wait for the reindeer, wish you would’ve stayed here
'Cause December is better with two

All the leaves fell from the trees
We were never evergreen
Guess it wasn’t meant to be for me and you

[Verse 2]
The fire just faded without you
There’s nothing to light up the room
The way that your eyes did when you’d get excited
When we danced to old Christmas tunes
And Santa was asking about you
When he made his way down from the roof
And he filled up your stocking before I could stop him
And tell him you found somewhere new

[Chorus]
All the leaves fell from the trees
We were never evergreen
Guess it wasn’t meant to be for me and you

I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

And tell me all your stories
So I can sleep in peace

But tomorrow always follows
So I tie up my lips for you, babe

There's an old Australian bush song
That Melba used to sing
A song that always cheered me when I was blue

Was a helluva song to sing
So be quiet whilst I render it for you

Is approaching you faster and faster
Then be like the blue bird and sing

Don't allow the old face to look paler

I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor
And you're torn if you should leave him with a numbers

Because too many of his promises got broken on the way
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say

The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella

On a dash so I take a Risk
It’s the ending on a body glitch
Brooklyn 2 am subway skit
Shooting my video is the only shit
Rick runners had to skate to it
To my scene hop the fare gate Fuck a slit
Back to the roof cause we executed
Bearly level to it
Level up got me when I’m booted
Young nigga so he had to juice it
Lemonade got me sipping paint
Got to kill me if you want to take
Nighttime when I serenade
Deserts night cacti cutting blades
So slick on my wolf shit
7th life fur growing thick
Got to shed my body into it

Matrix riding with my ken
7 life got a to push a Benz
On the end
Got to push the limit
I was here so I got to win it
You never seen it
So you reminiscing
Focus rite
I got to focus right
In my crib in the night time
Peep blinds with a pipe iron
Night vision so I’m on light

I wanna come home to roses
And dirty little notes on Post-its
And when my hair starts turning gray
He'll say I'm like a fine wine, better with age
I guess I learned it from my parents
That true love starts with friendship
A kiss on the forehead, a date night
Fake an apology after a fight

[Chorus]
I need a man who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car and holds the door
I wanna slow dance in the living room like
We're eighteen at senior prom and grow
Old with someone who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom

[Verse 2]
I wanna road trip in the summers
I wanna make fun of each other
I wanna rock out to Billy Joel
And flip our kids off when they call us old
He'll accidentally burn our dinner
And let me be the Scrabble winner
And when my body changes shapes
He'll say, ""Oh my God, you look hot today""

I yelled upstairs, ""Hey Mom, I'm off to grab some smokes.""
And my Father called, ""Why you need to smoke so late?""
Well I'd lied, I had a date

Free from my folks' enslavement
Skippin' along the pavement
To see a brunette, who I'd never met
But I'd never would forget, how she looked in that dress

How she stuck out her hand and said
""My name is Cecily Smith
And I hope you like music, cause I've got two tickets for La Traviata""
That's when I said ""I hate opera.""

She laughed and said
""Well lucky for you, that you're with Cecily Smith
Who cares what you are listening to, it's who you're listening with.""

So we take our seats, her hands are folded in her lap
If not a kiss, then I at least would get a nap
So I close my eyes as the orchestra begins
Then I hear violins

And the hair on my neck was rising
A feeling new and surprising
But it wasn't the sound that made my heart pound
No, it was because I found her hand is in mine
You might also likeAnd that's where it will stay until they play the final chord
She says, ""Were you bored?""
And I say, ""I guess it wasn't quite so bad
It was the best time that I ever had""

She laughed and said, ""Well lucky for you, I got seats to Beethoven's fifth
Who cares what you are listening to it's who you're listening with.""

A perfect wife
A perfect life

The time exploded like a bullet from a gun
A week, a year, and then a marriage, and a son
And a rental where I still can hear her laugh
When I play the phonograph

So I let the music guide me
And Cecily sits beside me
A girl of nineteen
With a nervous marine
Feel her head begin to lean
As the melody soars

And though it was real
It doesn't feel like it could be
That night when you said to me that
""I've got two tickets for La Traviata.""
It's sad but true, how much I miss you
I miss you Cecily Smith

Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor
And you're torn if you should leave him with a numbers

[Chorus]
And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say
And you tell him that you're never coming home

[Verse 2]
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's right
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her

[Verse 3]
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better
I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late
I'm almost done and then I see the letter

[Chorus]
In his imagination she's a universe away
Too many of his promises got broken on the way
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say
And she told him she was never coming home

With my fish tryna teach him how to speak now
Imma fight a stingray cuz im a freak now

I got no fly I got no game kinda nose dive like a broke plane
I got standards but got no shame
I still get texts from an old flame
That's an old game I stay away like the old plague

I could explode on this whole thing C3H8 propane

Just wanna reach out but you don't reply

Staying in my home like it's been advertised
This is the life don't care if your away

At Wanamaker's and Saks and Klein's, a lesson I've been taught
You can't get alterations on a dress you haven't bought
At any vegetable market from Borneo to Nome

You've simply got to gamble, you get no guarantee
Now doesn't that kind of apply to you and I, you and me?
Whatever
Why not?
Why not what?
Marry the man today, trouble though he may be
Much as he likes to play, crazy and wild and free
Marry the man today, rather than sigh in sorrow
Marry the man today and change his ways tomorrow
Marry the man today (Marry the man today)
Maybe he's leaving town (Maybe he's leaving town)
Don't let him get away (Don't let him get away)
Hurry and track him down (Counterattack him and)
Marry the man today, give him the girlish laughter
Give him your hand today and save the fist for after
Slowly introduce him to the better things
Respectable, conservative, and clean
Readers Digest, Guy Lombardo, Rogers Peet, golf, galoshes, Ovaltine
But marry the man today, handle it meek and gently
Marry the man today and train him subsequently
Carefully expose him to domestic life
And if he ever tries to stray from you
Have a pot roast
Have a headache
Have a baby
Have two

Stop
Marry the man today, rather than sigh and sorrow

When I was just a fan
I played those ol' scratched up records
Of the Drifting Cowboys Band
When he was just a legend
And they were only songs
But now I find myself on the same Lost Highway he was on
All because of you
Honey thanks
'Cause now I'm understandin' Hank

Yeah it's the bottle, it's a Cold Cold Heart
It's livin' just to die
Its the Lovesick Blues, gettin' over you
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
A ramblin' man with a midnight train rollin' through his veins
From the life he lived down to every song he sing
I'm understandin' Hank

I'm just like that hollowed soul underneath the nudie suit
I know what he meant when he sang I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love With You
And I can feel the beat of Your Cheatin' Heart as I lie alone at night
Now every note Hank Williams ever moaned
It tears me up inside all because of you
Yeah honey thanks

It's a chance to fill the seam

Long socks and stocking and jumpers and ties
Badges and laces and rucksacks and lies
Tell me why is the school disco our most popular club night?
In England this is a number one weekend retreat
Lines of over 18s dressed as sexy 13s
Standing in school skirts free entry allowed
If you're dressed as a naughty school uniform crowd
Oi oi girls he shouts
I don't get it, I remember the warnings
Gates closed at lunch 'coz this pervert was stalking us
And 2 of my friends had already been flashed
And as I walked home from school
I noticed the van
At the corner
The guy at the window
Tongue between fingers wistling blows
Signing me blowjobs as I stood in my school clothes
Upping the pace I sprint down the road scared witless
Now 13 years later you want me to wear
The same uniform then to turn on grown men stares
The school disco club night we come in our hordes
Get low with a schoolgirl without breaking laws
So I can get chatted up by some dribbling men
Who like looking at me looking like I did in year 10
And I don't get it I'd rather dance dressed like a woman
And if I look sexy I want to look like a woman
I'd rather be chatted up as a woman
And if perverts stare, well they can stare at a woman
And I like being a woman I am not a little girl
And years passing me by are not the end of the world
Life as a woman is the best that it's been
And I like being me I don't want to be 15 again
Worrying about school tests and coolness and spots
I don't want to wear school skirts or flirt in my pop socks
As I am told everyday to obsess to back then
But I'd rather live life as a woman
Still I see us in lines on Saturday afternoon
Sitting with friends in mordern new tea rooms
The cupcake is back
This is bakings new black
Pastel shade icing and sprinkles on stacks
The new female fad is jamming up Twitter
Recipes sprinling candies with glitter
I don't get it I remember the parties
The last time I ate those I was still using potties
Grabbing at bowls of soggy chip dippers
Pineapple, cheese sticks and soft chocolate fingers
And in the middle of the table making us sick
Sweet little cupcakes with glittery bits
Now 20 years later the cupcake is back
As women sit nibbling party girl snakcs
And I dont actually mind cupcakes
I am just tired of every female fad telling me I should still be a child
Wrinkle cream, anti-age on female shop aisles
Now even our food has copied the style
Jelly is back
The cupcake is back
And beside all Top Shop tills are those lollypop stacks
Big bowls of bubblegum for grown up mummies next to pop socks and cherries
Why not nappies and dummies?
Telling us to be younger and girly and sweet
And quiet and good and thanful for treats
I don't get it I would rather eat food for a woman
And if I meet friends I wanna meet as a woman
I'd rather drink afternoon tea as a woman
laugh and be happy and free as a woman
'Coz I like being a woman
I am not a little girl
And the years passing me by are not the end of the world
And my life as a woman is the best that it's been
And I like being me
I don't want to be 3 again
With cakes held before me as bribes to be good
And fingers grabbing at soggy licked food as I am told everyday to obsess to back then
But I would rather live life as a woman
I don't want to wear school skirts, I'd rather have mine on
I don't want to wear pop socks I'd rather have tights on
I don't want to pretend I know that that time's gone
And I don't really want cupcakes I'd rather have scones
Or any damn cake without fairy wings on
And it might be a surprise but I like being a woman
I like looking like a woman
Dancing feeling sexy or caressing as a woman
I like eating like a woman
Meeting friends like a woman
Being treated, being pleased and be in peae to be a woman
And with each day I am getting older
And I know only death is gunna stop that
And I can go with it or I can live life looking back
And I can raise my little girl to think her meaning stops at 20
Dreamin Never-Neverland that ticking clocks are all the enemy
And this little girly culture is kinda helping with that step
School uniform parties, cupcakes, botox, tucks and stress
Obsessed with being so young again as if those days were best
As if Alice stepped all the way down the hole and never left again
Frozen in tea party time Mad Hatters, mice and childrens rhymes
Never-women, girls for life, lollypops and glittered icing
For me that life is not enticing
So just incase you don't hear right
I will say it twice again
I like living life as a woman
I am looking forward to living life as a womanEmbed",1,0,2

I set every star into place
So you would remember my name
I made it all for you
You are my masterpiece
You are the reason I sing
This is my song for you
Every star in the sky

So you would remember my name, ohh

You are my masterpiece
You are the reason I sing, yeah
This is my song for you

[Chorus]
I'm reaching out, oh, I'll chase you down
Come on I dare you just believe
Won't you believe that I love you? I really love you
Don't be afraid, know that I am your strength
You can trust me
